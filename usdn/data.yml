      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * he Neutrino index is a decentralized financial (DeFi) platform based on the Waves blockchain. The platform rebranded its index token from USDN to XTN. Neutrino has two native tokens, XTN and NSBT.
          * XTN is an algorithmic crypto-collateralized indexcoin backed by three Waves Ecosystem tokens: WAVES, WX and VIRES. XTN's main function is to encourage user participation in the Neutrino by rewarding those who provide liquidity to the system.
          * The platform’s other token, NSBT (Neutrino System Base Token), is used for governance purposes: it allows users to make decisions about the future development of the Neutrino protocol, and it ensures the stability of collateral reserves on Neutrino’s smart contract.
          * New NSBT tokens are issued whenever a user locks WAVES tokens on a contract, which serves as additional backing and insures the system against a deficit. Holders can stake to earn on WAVES to XTN swap fees.
