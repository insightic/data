overview: |
  Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH) represents your staked Ethereum (ETH) and the staking reward received, in a tradable and transferable form. WBETH accumulates ETH staking rewards by growing in value in relation to ETH, even when it is used in Binance products or DeFi Projects.
history: |
  WBETH is a tokenized representation of staked ETH, where each WBETH is equivalent to one ETH plus any accumulated staking rewards from ETH Staking.\n\nWBETH enables holders to access instant liquidity and engage with DeFi platforms while retaining their entitlement to the staking rewards associated with ETH Staking.\n\nUsers on the blockchain can convert their ETH into WBETH by utilizing the dedicated smart contract provided by Binance.\nBinance account holders have the option to convert their BETH into WBETH and vice versa on the Binance ETH Staking platform without incurring any fees.
