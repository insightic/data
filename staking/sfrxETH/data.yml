overview: |
  Staked Frax Ether (sfrxETH) is a liquid Ethereum (ETH) staking derivative and stablecoin system designed to leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and simplify the Ethereum staking process.
  The core logic of Staked Frax Ether involves three primary components: Frax Ether (frxETH), Staked Frax Ether (sfrxETH), and the Frax ETH Minter. frxETH acts as a stablecoin loosely pegged to ETH, sfrxETH is the version of frxETH which accrues staking yield, and the Frax ETH Minter allows the exchange of ETH for frxETH.
  Staked Frax Ether is a product of Frax Finance, a decentralized finance protocol known for its innovative stablecoin infrastructure. The exact year of its inception and the individuals or teams behind it are not explicitly stated in the available resources.
  While specific historical milestones for Staked Frax Ether are not readily available, it's worth noting that the token has seen significant price movements. For instance, it reached an all-time high of $7,545.09 on February 16, 2023, and an all-time low of $1,147.58 on December 23, 2022.

        value: |
          * Frax Ether is a liquid ETH staking derivative and stablecoin system designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smoothen the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH. 
          * The Frax Ether system comprises three primary components, Frax Ether (frxETH), Staked Frax Ether (sfrxETH), and the Frax ETH Minter:
            frxETH acts as a stablecoin loosely pegged to ETH, leveraging Frax's winning playbook on stablecoins and onboarding ETH into the Frax ecosystem. The frxETH peg is defined as 1% of the exchange rate on each side 1.01 to .9900. 
            sfrxETH is the version of frxETH which accrues staking yield. All profit generated from Frax Ether validators is distributed to sfrxETH holders. By exchanging frxETH for sfrxETH, one become's eligible for staking yield, which is redeemed upon converting sfrxETH back to frxETH.
            Frax ETH Minter (frxETHMinter) allows the exchange of ETH for frxETH, bringing ETH into the Frax ecosystem, spinning up new validator nodes when able, and minting new frxETH equal to the amount of ETH sent.
