    "report_summary": "The report thoroughly details overall security results, specific vulnerabilities, and methodologies employed, using industry-standard OWASP Risk Rating Methodology and clear categorical severities, yet lacks specifics on static and dynamic analysis techniques. It effectively prioritizes risks by severity and potential impact, providing actionable insights but admits to limitations due to time constraints and client information, potentially missing undetected risks. While the report is structured and understandable with clear language and contains disclaimers and communication strategies for remediation, it falls short in detailing auditing methodologies and code review specifics. In summary, the security assessment report is comprehensive and structured, effectively identifying and prioritizing risks, yet it's moderate in clarity regarding auditing strategies and methodologies.",
    "biz_content": "The audited project's business logic/framework is described in the following content:\n\n- The Terra protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for algorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and decentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on the Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The Terra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable demand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna .\n  \n- Terra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. Stablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra stablecoin tracks the price of the IMF's SDR, named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include TerraUSD or UST, and TerraKRW or KRT. All Terra denominations exist in the same pool. Luna is the Terra protocol's native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is used for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is used, the more Luna is worth .\n\n- The audited code mainly contains three core modules:\n  - Market: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin denominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, stable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets.\n  - Oracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price feed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair exchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna.\n  - Treasury: The Treasury module acts as the \"central bank\" of the Terra economy, measuring macroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate miner incentives toward stable, long-term growth .\n\n",
