Trail of Bits conducted a security assessment of Paxos, with Dan Guido and Anne Marie Barry managing the project, and Alexander Remie, Tarun Bansal, and Kurt Willis as the associated engineers. The most critical issues identified likely pertain to vulnerabilities in the smart contract code that could affect the stability and security of the token. The audit's findings are essential for addressing potential security risks and ensuring the integrity of the Stablecoin. To improve, the team could implement the recommended fixes and regularly update security protocols to mitigate future risks.",
