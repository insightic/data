This is accomplished by integrating the Alliance module and approving yield-generating tokens from other chains as Alliance assets, allowing users to stake them to earn a portion of native staking rewards.\n\nCash flows from other chains can be used to augment and diversify the staking yield of the native coin, making it a more compelling asset to hold and stake. Meanwhile, holders of allied coins have more avenues to boost their yield, providing additional utility to the allied coin. \n\nLearn how to stake Alliance assets on Terra \ud83d\udc47https://lnkd.in/eXKhPP4W",
