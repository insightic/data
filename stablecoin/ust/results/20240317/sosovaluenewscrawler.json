The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argues that this matter should be decided by a judge.\n\nIn February, the SEC sued Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, accusing them of \"issuing and selling a series of interrelated securities, most of which were unregistered transactions,\" raising billions of dollars from investors. This week, Terraform Labs' lawyer David Kornblau wrote to Judge Jed Rakoff, stating that \"the jury should decide whether the SEC has met its burden of proof to show that UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR tokens are securities.\" This letter was sent after the SEC submitted a letter arguing that there has almost never been a jury decision on whether something is an investment contract.\n\nTerraform Labs had previously requested a favorable summary judgment from the judge, rather than a full trial. However, if the judge chooses not to grant a summary judgment, Terraform Labs requests that the matter be submitted to a jury decision. The company pointed out that in the precedent of Audet v. Fraiser in 2021, a jury had ruled that four types of cryptocurrencies were not securities. Meanwhile, the SEC argued that this is the only case that requires a jury to define whether something is an investment contract.

This week, Terraform Labs' lawyer David Kornblau wrote to Judge Jed Rakoff, stating that \"the jury should decide whether the SEC has met its burden of proof to show that UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR tokens are securities.\" This letter was sent after the SEC submitted a letter arguing that there has almost never been a jury decision on whether something is an investment contract.\n\nTerraform Labs had previously requested a favorable summary judgment from the judge, rather than a full trial. However, if the judge chooses not to grant a summary judgment, Terraform Labs requests that the matter be submitted to a jury decision. The company pointed out that in the precedent of Audet v. Fraiser in 2021, a jury had ruled that four types of cryptocurrencies were not securities. Meanwhile, the SEC argued that this is the only case that requires a jury to define whether something is an investment contract.
