    "biz_content": "The Terra system is mainly composed of a Terra protocol, and two tokesn including Terra and \nLuna.\n\n- The Terra protocol\n\nThe Terra protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for \nalgorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and \ndecentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price \nof any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on \nthe Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The \nTerra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable \ndemand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna.\n\n- Terra and Luna\n\nThe protocol consists of two main tokens, Terra and Luna.\nTerra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. \nStablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra stablecoin tracks \nthe price of the IMF s SDR, named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include \nTerraUSD or UST, and TerraKRW or KRT. All Terra denominations exist in the same pool.\nLuna is the Terra protocol s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is \nused for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify \ntransactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is \nused, the more Luna is worth. \n\nThe audited code mainly contains three core modules:\n\nMarket: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin \ndenominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, \nstable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets.\n\nOracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price \nfeed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair \nexchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna.\n\nTreasury: The Treasury module acts as the \"central bank\" of the Terra economy, measuring \nmacroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate \nminer incentives toward stable, long-term growth.\n\nThe issues that the Fairyproof team covered when conducting the audit include but are not \nlimited to the following ones:\n\n- General Code Issues\n\nCorrectness of the implementation;\nAdversarial actions and other attacks on Modules;\nPotential misuse and gaming of the all Modules;\nAttacks that impacts funds, such as the draining or the manipulation of funds;\nMismanagement of funds via transactions;\nModules s intended use or disrupt the execution;\nVulnerabilities in Modules code, particularly for swapping, earning, and creating pools;\nVulnerabilities in the interaction between Modules and other existing Cosmos-SDK modules;\nProtection against malicious attacks and other ways to exploit the Modules;\nInappropriate permissions and excess authority;\nData privacy, data leaking, and information integrity;\nSecure interfaces to the application (API and CLI);\nImplementation Vulnerability\nCode Improvement\nMisc\n\n- Network Interactions\n\nAttacks on all Modules through the network and secure communication between Modules \nand network components;\nSpam attacks that bottleneck the functionality and the entire network by exhausting \ncomputation power or traffic bandwidth, leading to a monopoly of submitting transactions \nto the network (minimal competition among participants can lead to extreme inefficiency of\nprice discovery);\n- Economics\n\nReview of the economic incentives, including the intended functions and potential impact;\nWeaknesses in the economic model resulting in user attacks again the Modules;\nAttack vectors that can game the trading environment and cause unnecessary costs to \nordinary users; \n\n- Compliance with Cosmos\n\n06. Severity level reference\n\nEvery issue in this report was assigned a severity level from the following:\n\nCritical severity issues need to be fixed as soon as possible.\n\nHigh severity issues will probably bring problems and should be fixed.\n\nMedium severity issues could potentially bring problems and should eventually be fixed.\n\nLow severity issues are minor details and warnings that can remain unfixed but would be better \nfixed at some point in the future.\n\nNeutral is not an issue or risk but a suggestion for code improvement.\n\n07.
