        "biz_content": "The Terra system is mainly composed of a Terra protocol, and two tokesn including Terra and \nLuna.\n\n- The Terra protocol\n\nThe Terra protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for \nalgorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and \ndecentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price \nof any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on \nthe Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The \nTerra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable \ndemand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna.\n\n- Terra and Luna\n\nThe protocol consists of two main tokens, Terra and Luna.\nTerra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. \nStablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra stablecoin tracks \nthe price of the IMF s SDR, named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include \nTerraUSD or UST, and TerraKRW or KRT. All Terra denominations exist in the same pool.\nLuna is the Terra protocol s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is \nused for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify \ntransactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is \nused, the more Luna is worth. \n\nThe audited code mainly contains three core modules:\n\nMarket: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin \ndenominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, \nstable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets.\n\nOracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price \nfeed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair \nexchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna.\n\nTreasury: The Treasury module acts as the \"central bank\" of the Terra economy, measuring \nmacroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate \nminer incentives toward stable, long-term growth.\n\n",

Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly on the blockchain. Luna provides staking rewards and governance power.

Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and decentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on the Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The Terra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable demand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna.\" \n  \n- \"Terra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. Stablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra stablecoin tracks the price of the IMF's SDR, named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include TerraUSD or UST, and TerraKRW or KRT. All Terra denominations exist in the same pool. Luna is the Terra protocol's native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is used for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is used, the more Luna is worth.\" \n\n- \"The audited code mainly contains three core modules: Market, Oracle and Treasury. Market: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin denominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, stable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets. Oracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price feed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair exchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna. Treasury: The Treasury module acts as the 'central bank' of the Terra economy, measuring macroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate miner incentives toward stable, long-term growth.\" \n- Economics\n\nReview of the economic incentives, including the intended functions and potential impact;\nWeaknesses in the economic model resulting in user attacks again the Modules;\nAttack vectors that can game the trading environment and cause unnecessary costs to \nordinary users; \n\n- Compliance with Cosmos\n\n06.

Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and decentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price of any fiat currency.\" \n\n- \"Terra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. Stablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts... Luna is the Terra protocol's native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is used for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees.\" \n\n- \"The audited code mainly contains three core modules:\n\nMarket: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin denominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, stable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets.\n\nOracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price feed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair exchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna.\n\nTreasury: The Treasury module acts as the 'central bank' of the Terra economy, measuring macroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate miner incentives toward stable, long-term growth.\" \nReview of the economic incentives, including the intended functions and potential impact;\nWeaknesses in the economic model resulting in user attacks again the Modules;\nAttack vectors that can game the trading environment and cause unnecessary costs to \nordinary users; \n\nDescription:\nIn the  core/x/market/spec/01_concepts.md  file, the  Swap Procedure  section didn't describe \nthe code's behavior. \nComments:\nConsider changing the descriptions for  Swap Procedure  and removing the section for \nSeigniorage .\n\nDescription:\nIn line 81 of the  x/market/keeper/msg_server.go  file when  TerraPoolDelta  was updated \nspread fee  was deducted.
