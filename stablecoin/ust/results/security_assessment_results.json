        "biz_content": "The Terra system is mainly composed of a Terra protocol, and two tokesn including Terra and \nLuna.\n\n- The Terra protocol\n\nThe Terra protocol is the leading decentralized and open-source public blockchain protocol for \nalgorithmic stablecoins. Using a combination of open market arbitrage incentives and \ndecentralized oracle voting, the Terra protocol creates stablecoins that consistently track the price \nof any fiat currency. Users can spend, save, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly, all on \nthe Terra blockchain. Luna provides its holders with staking rewards and governance power. The \nTerra ecosystem is a quickly expanding network of decentralized applications, creating a stable \ndemand for Terra and increasing the price of Luna.\n\n- Terra and Luna\n\nThe protocol consists of two main tokens, Terra and Luna.\nTerra is a stablecoin that tracks the price of fiat currencies. Users mint new Terra by burning Luna. \nStablecoins are named for their fiat counterparts. For example, the base Terra stablecoin tracks \nthe price of the IMF s SDR, named TerraSDR, or SDT. Other stablecoin denominations include \nTerraUSD or UST, and TerraKRW or KRT. All Terra denominations exist in the same pool.\nLuna is the Terra protocol s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is \nused for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify \ntransactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is \nused, the more Luna is worth. \n\nThe audited code mainly contains three core modules:\n\nMarket: The Market module enables atomic swaps between different Terra stablecoin \ndenominations, and between Terra and Luna. This module ensures an available, liquid market, \nstable prices, and fair exchange rates between the protocol's assets.\n\nOracle: The Oracle module provides the Terra blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price \nfeed of exchange rates of Luna against various Terra pegs so that the Market may provide fair \nexchanges between Terra<>Terra currency pairs, as well as Terra<>Luna.\n\nTreasury: The Treasury module acts as the \"central bank\" of the Terra economy, measuring \nmacroeconomic activity by observing indicators and adjusting monetary policy levers to modulate \nminer incentives toward stable, long-term growth.\n\n",
