                "headline": "Ethena\u2019s $400m USDe token sparks renewed debate over stablecoin label",
                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "headline": "The winners and losers as stablecoin volume crosses $1tn",
                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Squid secures $4m to fuel competition in one-click transfers between blockchains",
                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice.

Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals.

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate.

Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year.

At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier.

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations. JPEX said it had \u201cstrived to comply\u201d with the rules that took effect in June, but its efforts were \u201cdismissed or sidestepped with official rhetoric,\u201d according to the report. Coinbase was approved by the Bank of Spain as a Bitcoin and digital assets exchange and custodial wallet service provider, Crypto.News reported.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier. Serbian authorities have so far been quiet about the case, but the joint investigation between these two countries was confirmed when the South Korean prosecutors travelled to Serbia at the end of January to work together."

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier. Serbian authorities have so far been quiet about the case, but the joint investigation between these two countries was confirmed when the South Korean prosecutors travelled to Serbia at the end of January to work together."

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier. Serbian authorities have so far been quiet about the case, but the joint investigation between these two countries was confirmed when the South Korean prosecutors travelled to Serbia at the end of January to work together."

On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra.

An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier. Serbian authorities have so far been quiet about the case, but the joint investigation between these two countries was confirmed when the South Korean prosecutors travelled to Serbia at the end of January to work together."

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals. When contacted by DL News and asked if he knew that his client had been wanted by Interpol when he registered the company he said: \u201cI cannot comment without consulting my colleagues.\u201d NOW READ: EU regulators just launched a programme that will have massive implications for tokenisation News of Do Kwon hiding in Serbia broke in December 2022 when South Korean officials reported that he arrived in Serbia via Dubai a couple of months earlier. Serbian authorities have so far been quiet about the case, but the joint investigation between these two countries was confirmed when the South Korean prosecutors travelled to Serbia at the end of January to work together."

                "body": " Crypto fugitive Do Kwon\u2019s six month run has apparently come to an end. On Thursday, officials in Montenegro shocked the cryptocurrency world by disclosing that Kwon, the 31-year-old entrepreneur who once vowed to revolutionise finance, had been held at the airport in the Balkan nation\u2019s capital. Kwon was apprehended with falsified documents, said Interior Minister Filip Adzic. DL News has learned that authorities also arrested an associate believed to be Han Chang-joon, a senior executive at Chai, a mobile payment provider implicated in the alleged fraud at Terra, Kwon\u2019s failed crypto venture. \u201cMontenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs,\u201d Adzic said on Twitter. Dodging Interpol Wanted by prosecutors in his native South Korea in connection with the $40 billion collapse of Terra last May, Do Kwon has been dodging Interpol as he hopscotched around the world. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he withdrew $100 million from a Swiss bank account between June 2022 and February 2023. Kwon was last known to be in Serbia, and police in Belgrade had been hot on his trail and had begun a pre-extradition process, Branko Stamenkovic, Serbia\u2019s head of the Special Prosecution Office for High Tech Crime told DL News in an exclusive interview Thursday. Serbian authorities told DL News they are waiting for confirmation from Interpol that the man arrested is Do Kwon. \u201cI have no idea what logic he had in coming here,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News. \u201cWe were surprised\u2026 Maybe he thought because we have no bilateral extradition agreement with South Korea that he would be safe, but we are signatories to the same international treaty. If I knew where he was we would arrest him immediately.\u201d NOW READ: Meet the professor \u2018obsessed\u2019 with tracking crypto fugitive Do Kwon across the blockchain Stamenkovic made these comments about an hour before Montenegrin authorities announced Kwon\u2019s detention in Podgorica. South Korean officials appear to have been close to fixing Kwon\u2019s location for some time. In February, prosecutors travelled to Serbia seeking assistance in their pursuit of Do Kwon. Stamenkovic told DL News that Kwon was travelling with another South Korean man. The Asian nation\u2019s officials shared details of Do Kwon\u2019s movements and Serbian police were following several leads, according to Stamenkovic. But the trail had recently gone cold. \u2018It is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to leave Serbia, a landlocked nation that shares a porous border with several Balkan countries. Serbian citizens do not need a passport to cross into Montenegro, Bosnia and North Macedonia. \u201cIt is most likely because of actions undertaken by Serbian Prosecution and police for their extradition, arrest and additional evidence, that the suspects fled from the country trying to get refuge in the region,\u201d Stamenkovic told DL News after hearing news of the arrest. A most wanted man There has been no announcement on the official government website in Montenegro. \u201cAs soon as we get the official confirmation, the [Ministry of Interior] will announce,\u201d Adzic told DL News. The focus now will turn to whether Kwon can be extradited to South Korea to face fraud charges. After prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon in September, Interpol released a red notice seeking his detention. Authorities in Singapore, where Terra is based, are also investigating Kwon. And the SEC recently filed a civil action against Kwon and Terra. NOW READ: Coinbase \u2018welcomes\u2019 legal battle with SEC amid signs of widening crypto crackdown That Kwon materialised in Montenegro is the latest twist in a saga that has both riveted and appalled the crypto community. An effervescent personality, Kwon regaled his million Twitter followers with dreams of creating a quasi-central bank for crypto predicated on Terra\u2019s blockchain network and array of interlocking tokens. Using a governance token called LUNA, Kwon built an ecosystem complete with an algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and a decentralised savings protocol dubbed Anchor that promised investors annual returns of 19 to 20%. Terra also created a form of crypto derivative called \u201cmirrored assets\u201d that tracked the performance of stocks such as Apple\u2019s shares. Ecosystem collapse To assuage liquidity concerns and support the stablecoin, Kwon set up a reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was funded with 50 million LUNA tokens. Investors bet big on Kwon\u2019s ambition: In 2021, LUNA\u2019s value multiplied 136 times and its market cap hit an all-time high of $41 billion in April 2022. When rising interest rates soured the macroeconomic picture in the second quarter of 2022 and triggered a swoon in the crypto markets, UST could no longer muster enough confidence, or reserves, to support its $1 peg. When it started sliding that May it dragged down LUNA and Anchor and in the space of a couple of weeks the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Terra collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. Investors were stunned by what many called crypto\u2019s \u201cLehman moment,\u201d in reference to the Wall Street investment bank that sparked the global financial crash of 2008. Just like that prior crisis, the fall of Terra triggered a wave of contagion that poleaxed Three Arrows Capital, a multi-billion dollar crypto hedge fund, the brokerage Voyager Digital, and eventually, FTX, which was the second biggest crypto exchange worldwide when it failed. Yet Terra wasn\u2019t an innocent casualty of a brutal bear market, officials in the US and South Korea say. It collapsed, they allege, because at its core it was a fraudulent scheme to rip off investors. In February, the SEC painted a picture of Kwon as a PT Barnum-type huckster rather than a crypto visionary in a lawsuit it filed against him and Terraform Labs, his parent company. NOW READ: The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future Beginning in 2019, Kwon trumpeted how a mobile payment provider in South Korea called Chai was using the Terra blockchain to process and settle payments. Kwon, who was a founder of Chai, promoted the \u201creal world use case\u201d as a breakthrough in numerous appearances in social media and the financial press. But the SEC said his claims were false. Chai was processing payments through conventional digital banking systems, not Terra\u2019s blockchain, and Terra faked the payments on its network, the agency said. \u201cTerraform and Kwon misleadingly used Chai\u2019s growth as a proxy for the growth and success of the Terraform ecosystem as a whole,\u201d the SEC\u2019s complaint states. Mysterious associate On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency said that Kwon and a person believed to be former CEO Han Chang-joon of Chai Corporation, a affiliate of Terraform Labs, were arrested by Montenegro authorities and are checking their identities, according to press reports. The police are waiting for a reply after requesting fingerprint information from the Montenegrin authorities to confirm the identifies of Kwon and Han. When asked by DL News if the person arrested with Kwon is Han, Adzic, the Minister of the Interior, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t received official confirmation yet, but we assume it\u2019s him.\u201d Updated on March 23 to add details of Kwon\u2019s associate, detention, Serbia\u2019s investigation of his whereabouts, and details of the SEC case."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " A recent plunge in a new algorithmic stablecoin has triggered debate over the safety of the offering, which is trading on one of the most influential \u2013 and widely used \u2013 blockchains. So too has a design feature that some DeFi investors say may be flawed. Yet Cardano, a blockchain network that boasts the fifth highest cryptocurrency by market cap, is determined to show that this version of an algorithmic stablecoin can overcome scepticism left over from the meltdown of Terra\u2019s UST token last year. \u2018Flash-crash\u2019 Last week, doubts mounted when the stablecoin DJED fell to as low as 96 cents and then a staggering 13 cents on the dollar according to data on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to the US dollar, are not supposed to fall pennies below $1 let alone 87 cents. Investors were shocked by what one called a \u201cflash-crash.\u201d Yet COTI, the blockchain venture that created DJED on behalf of Cardano, said the 13 cent price on Coingecko was due to an integration error. \u201cThe price was displayed incorrectly,\u201d said Prince, a community manager at COTI. Still, the action didn\u2019t deter DJED from becoming the fourth largest DeFi protocol on the Cardano blockchain at $10.5 million in total value locked a month after its launch, according to DeFiLlama. The rollout appears to be a win for Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, a pioneer in DeFi who helped develop Ethereum. Hoskinson bristles at comparisons between DJED and TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that slipped its peg last May and triggered the collapse of a $60 billion ecosystem and spread contagion across the sector. Asked how DJED is different from Terra\u2019s UST, Hoskinson replied with a single word: \u201dOvercollateralisation.\u201d This means the stablecoin is backed by a reserve several times its value. READ NOW: DeFi \u2018threat\u2019 drives $1.5B tokenisation boom as Goldman, SocGen eye on-chain bonds Ever since Terra\u2019s failure, investors have been wary of algorithmic stablecoins. This is because normal stablecoins are usually backed by the US dollar or the euro or even gold. Their relative stability makes them attractive to investors looking for havens from volatility. They also provide investors with hassle-free ways to trade cryptocurrencies without converting to fiat currencies. But algorithmic stablecoins tend to be backed by other cryptocurrencies, making them far more volatile. They can slip their peg to the dollar under extreme market pressure, or due to flaws in their design. \u2018People are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised.\u2019 The plunges in DJED generated concern on Crypto Twitter. Critics are uneasy about the way the stablecoin works, saying its collateralisation approach is a key risk to the protocol\u2019s safety. At the heart of the offering is \u2018overcollateralisation.\u2019 DJED\u2019s protocol requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400%. In practice, that means new DJED stablecoins can only be \u2018minted\u2019, or created, when the reserve\u2019s value is at least four times the supply of outstanding DJED. Direct implications DJED\u2019s reserve is made up entirely of Cardano\u2019s native token, ADA, not dollars. \u201cPeople are still weary of algorithm controlled stablecoins even if they are overcollateralised,\u201d Subcritical, the sobriquet of a Cardano DeFi user, told DL News. \u201cMany in the community are not sure we need it, and would prefer to have a fiat-backed stablecoin.\u201d The stablecoin\u2019s design has direct implications for holders of the DJED\u2019s reserve token, SHEN. Contributors to DJED\u2019s reserve create or \u2018mint\u2019 SHEN as they deposit their ADA to the reserve. In other words, investors who convert their ADA into SHEN act as lenders of last resort and assume the risk if DJED drops below the dollar peg. For helping build and maintain DJED\u2019s reserve, SHEN holders are paid periodic rewards. Redeeming tokens If the value of DJED\u2019s reserve falls below the minimum ratio of 400%, then the protocol is designed to lock holders\u2019 SHEN until that ratio is met once again. This, DJED\u2019s detractors argue, would prevent SHEN holders from redeeming their tokens in order to withdraw the ADA they originally deposited to the reserve. So the maintenance of a steady reserve punishes investors who make the reserve possible in the first place. They cannot easily withdraw their funds. DJED\u2019s own whitepaper notes the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic emerging if the reserve ratio approaches its minimum threshold. SHEN holders may want to sell their holdings for fear of them getting locked, in turn lowering the reserve, and creating a self-reinforcing loop, it says. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST was also subject to a similar dynamic. \u2018Barring the doors\u2019 One user has speculated that a lockup of SHEN holders might prompt dumping of SHEN on decentralized exchanges. \u201cYou can lock in the collateral of SHEN holders by not allowing them to withdraw when reserves are low, but you cannot do anything about the value of that ADA collateral,\u201d said Kyle Downey, CEO and co-founder of Cloudwall, a digital assets risk management firm. \u201cThe question becomes: could that \u2018barring of the doors\u2019 itself trigger a panic that affects collateral value?\u201d Downey said. COTI told DL News that ADA has \u201cdeep liquidity\u201d and that it had examined \u201cthe maximum monthly decrease of ADA\u2019s price, which was found to be around 66% at the time of research.\u201d READ NOW: Hedge fund short seller says Silvergate crash may be a sign of the bottom While a reserve ratio of 300% would be \u201csufficient\u201d to cover such a decrease in ADA, COTI said it set the ratio at 400% \u201cto provide additional safety for DJED holders in extreme cases.\u201d Reserve draining attacks Looking at a past experiment, Cardano community members warn of other potential issues with DJED. In 2021, a raid on a stablecoin\u2019s reserves against an earlier version of DJED, called SigmaUSD, on the Ergo blockchain exploited a vulnerability. According to the Ergo blog post detailing the attack, holders of the reserve token, SigRSV \u2013 an analogue of SHEN \u2013 found themselves unable to redeem their funds because the attacker exploited a loophole that kept the reserves locked at the 400% ratio. DJED\u2019s whitepaper acknowledged the risk of such events, which are known as reserve-draining attacks. At the same time, it noted that later adjustments to SigmaUSD seem to have prevented further incursions. The paper also said that SigmaUSD was able to maintain its peg during a market crash in May 2021, when Bitcoin dipped below $35,000 only to recover two months later. \u201cIn order to conduct such an attack, the attacker would have to correctly predict ADA\u2019s volatile price change, in accordance with the oracle\u2019s price prediction\u201d COTI said. \u201cIn addition, we set a 1.5% fee to prevent such an attack from being profitable.\u201d"

                "headline": "Ethena\u2019s $400m USDe token sparks renewed debate over stablecoin label",
                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak.

The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " The US Securities and Exchange Commission outlined an expansive new view of its jurisdiction over crypto assets in the lawsuit it filed late last week against Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, who is currently on the run from Interpol. While the international manhunt for Kwon continues \u2014 he is suspected of being in Serbia or possibly Switzerland \u2014 the SEC\u2019s lawsuit gives a number of clues as to its current enforcement priorities. Most notably, the SEC continues to expand its view of what counts as a \u201csecurity.\u201d The entire complaint against Kwon is a lesson in the definition of \u201cthe Howey test\u201d, the legal definition of what counts as an investment that must be compliant with US law on assets like stocks and bonds. It also shows that the SEC is becoming more sophisticated in its coverage of crypto and, at the same time, less tolerant of allegedly unfair dealings in digital assets. This is potentially explosive for algorithmic stablecoins because they can be swapped for cryptocurrencies supposed to back them The collapse of Kwon\u2019s TerraUSD stablecoin last year wiped out $40 billion, the complaint claims. TerraUSD (UST) maintained its parity with the dollar via an algorithmic relationship with Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency, LUNA. Behind the two-way relationship was an arbitrage opportunity every time UST lost its peg in either direction. But they went into a death spiral after continuous selling of both tokens. The collapse started a contagion, and losses impacted Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Genesis and Digital Currency Group, and the FTX/ Alameda Research empire. One of the attractions of the Terra blockchain was its alleged relationship with Chai, a Korean mobile retail payments service that offered consumers the ability to buy things at shops and cinemas, with the transactions settled on the Terra blockchain. NOW READ: Gensler\u2019s history hints at what\u2019s coming next in the crypto crackdown However, the SEC claims that in reality, the payments were settled the traditional way, in online banking cash, and the company then \u201cdeceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain,\u201d as if they were happening on that chain when they were not, the complaint alleges. The SEC says it can prove this because it examined the timing of the blockchain transactions against the actual transactions on Chai: They were not the same. The complaint also alleges, for the first time, that a stablecoin is a security \u2013 in this case the stablecoin is UST. The intended purpose of stablecoins is to provide a crypto asset that exactly matches the value of a regular currency, usually US dollars. At first glance, stablecoins aren\u2019t like stocks or bonds because they more closely resemble traditional forms of electronic cash. So it will be controversial if the SEC insists in the US courts that stablecoins are akin to traditional investment \u201csecurities\u201d that fall under its jurisdiction. The SEC\u2019s main argument against stablecoins is that Terraform made UST available on its Anchor protocol. That platform offered \u201cinterest\u201d payments of 19% to 20%, to anyone willing to loan their UST to borrowers on the protocol. Thus UST functioned like a security offering profits in the future. Further, the SEC claims, UST was security because owning it gave users the right to swap it for Luna, the cryptocurrency whose supply was meant to back UST\u2019s peg to the dollar. \u201cGiven that UST investors had the right to convert UST to one dollar\u2019s worth of LUNA via Terra, investors who bought UST had the right to subscribe to or purchase a security,\u201d the suit says. This is potentially explosive for algorithmic stablecoins because they can be swapped for cryptocurrencies supposed to back them. In the case, the SEC claims that \u201cwrapped Luna\u201d (wLUNA) functioned as a \u201creceipt\u201d for a security. Tokens become \u201cwrapped\u201d when their \u201ctoken standards\u201d \u2013 the underlying technical details \u2013 are changed so that they fit better with another part of the blockchain or indeed another blockchain. In the case of wrapping across different blockchains, the token is disabled on the origin blockchain and a new token representing its exact value is created on the destination chain, via a \u201cwrap.\u201d The SEC is alleging that creating a wrapped version of a token when you move it from one chain to another is the same thing as generating a receipt for a security trade. The SEC has not made this argument before. Perhaps more obviously, the SEC is also making the case that Terraform\u2019s \u201cmAsset\u201d token \u2014 which algorithmically tracked traditional stocks \u2014 was also a security, because it worked like a swap in traditional finance. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly in terms of future enforcement, the SEC outlines its logic for intervening aggressively in crypto. It is very concerned with cases in which domestic retail investors lose their life savings. The suit contains a number of anecdotes about ordinary people who lost a lot of money on Luna and UST: \u201cFor example, a pharmacist in California borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA painter in Vermont invested $20,000 in UST set aside for his son\u2019s college education, but lost it all when the Terraform ecosystem collapsed.\u201d NOW READ: How Coinbase used Slack to sniff out its insider trader The SEC has signalled this to the markets before, but the signal was contained in a booklet that is little-read by crypto market participants: The \u201c2023 Examination Priorities\u201d report from the SEC\u2019s Division of Examinations. \u201cThe division will continue to monitor and, when appropriate, conduct examinations of potentially impacted or affected registrants,\u201d it says. Most ominously for crypto, the SEC said it intended to wade further into new waters: \u201cThe division will focus on new or never-before examined registrants offering crypto or crypto-related assets.\u201d Editor\u2019s note (February 21, 2023): This story has been updated with a revised paragraph to explain how TerraUSD functioned."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Anil Hansjee first expressed worry he was throwing $8 million into a black hole at 7:07 am on the morning of Monday, June 6, 2022, according to his emails. Hansjee is the London-based general partner at Fabric Ventures, a firm that makes investments in crypto startups. He was right to be anxious. Earlier in the year, he had committed to investing $8 million in Celsius, the cryptocurrency exchange. But by June, rumours were spreading that Celsius had been hit by the total collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which wiped about $45 billion off the crypto market. Hansjee wanted to know if his $8 million was going to be safe. His emails have been published as exhibits in the litigation around the bankruptcy of Celsius. The \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d \u2014 the lawyers appointed to recover as much money as possible from the wreckage \u2014 are suing Fabric for $6 million in US federal bankruptcy court. Fabric had paid $2 million of its $8 million investment commitment, but Hansjee and his colleagues refused to pay the remaining $6 million when it became obvious that Celsius was going under. The Celsius debtors now want all the money to be paid. They claim the investment contract Fabric signed remains binding, even if Celsius no longer exists as a functioning company. The investment may be small by crypto VC standards. And the core of the dispute will turn on the dry technicalities of contract law. But the emails give a rare glimpse at the behind-the-scenes panic that unfolds when a VC firm realises it has invested in a crypto company that is going bankrupt and is going to lose all its money. The tone of the emails is both polite and desperate, by turns casually anxious ,and then brutally formal. They also discuss matters that were supposed to be the subject of non-disclosure agreements, the emails state. A difficult and sudden U-turn Back in April 2022, Fabric was bullish on all things crypto and Hansjee couldn\u2019t move fast enough to invest in Celsius. At its peak, Celsius had $12 billion in assets under management. Hansjee practically begged to put money into the company. He wanted to buy $8 million in \u201cseries B\u201d preferred shares but needed time to come up with the cash. Celsius general counsel Ron Deutsch initially told him they were going to stick to their funding deadlines \u2014 which Fabric couldn\u2019t meet. On April 6, Hansjee asked for 90 days to gather the financing. He was happy to sign whatever commitment or contract was required, he said, as long as he was given time to get the cash from his limited partner investors. Deutsch was accommodating: \u201cAs long as we sign the subscription documents/commitments soon we can provide more time for funding,\u201d he told Hansjee. On April 7, Hansjee wrote to Deutsch: \u201cFirstly thanks for your understanding. Highly appreciated. Second, whatever we sign for we are making a HARD commitment for as professionals in this industry. So if we sign for 8m now, even if you were to allow a delayed funding, we would be good for this 8m. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding here and we don\u2019t treat it as an option.\u201d Just two months later, the weather had changed. With cryptocurrency prices in widescale freefall, Hansjee was starting to have doubts. \u2018Tough times I know!!\u2019 On June 6, he emailed Deutsch and Michael Greenblatt, Celsius\u2019s corporate counsel, to ask what was going on. \u201cMichael and Ron how are you? Tough times I know!!\u201d Then he expressed his fears for the first time. \u201cI would like to ask for some investor reporting to be sent our way. Especially in times like this it\u2019s critical to share some insights so we don\u2019t get hung up on social media news which has been overwhelmingly negative to Celsius, unfortunately.\u201d He had meetings with partner investors the following week, he said, \u201cand I will be expected to be able to comment at a high level in our portfolio companies and I\u2019m afraid I have no real insights on key matters such Celsius wrt [with relation to] market impact to $ inflows and AUM [assets under management], expected rev [revenue] and user and AUM growth for the year, timing of the IPO of the mining business in this current market, the CEL token collapse and the UST [stablecoin] story.\u201d \u201cIt would be useful for me to also know what elements are for my ears only,\u201d he wrote. He then noted, also for the first time, that he doubted he could meet a deadline for investing the next $2 million of his $8 million commitment, which was due at the end of the week. \u201cI would like to ask if we can delay this to accommodate a slight delay in our paper work,\u201d he said. He got his meeting with the executives at Celsius but remained worried. \u2018Damn the Torpedoes\u2019 The next day, Celsius posted a long essay on Medium, titled, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,\u201d in which the company argued that \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that vocal actors are spreading misinformation and confusion.\u201d \u201cThey have tried unsuccessfully, for example, to link Celsius to the collapse of Luna and falsely claim that Celsius sustained significant losses as a result,\u201d the company wrote. It also addressed the fact that some customers\u2019 accounts had been frozen \u2014 or placed in \u201cHODL mode\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for them to withdraw their funds. \u201cThey have stirred confusion around HODL mode and the importance of protecting user accounts,\u201d the essay said. Internally, Celsius executives believed they had escaped damage from the Luna fiasco. But customers were nonetheless withdrawing funds from the platform. Celsius\u2019s native token, CEL, had become nearly worthless, creating a potential run on the bank. But denying the rumours in such detail only gave them further life. Customers were freaked out that their accounts were locked as crypto prices crash all through the spring and summer. \u2018Liquidity crisis\u2019 Four days later, on June 10, Hansjee emailed Deutsch and Greenblatt again, requesting an update. This time, Hansjee used the phrase \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d \u2014 suggesting he believed Celsius might not survive. \u201cWhat are the current short term assets (cash and cash equivalents) vs equivalent liabilities? what are current withdrawals and what sort of withdrawal level will lead to a liquidity crisis?\u201d he wrote. On June 13, Celsius froze all customer accounts in an attempt to halt withdrawals so that the platform could be stabilised. Over the next few weeks, it became clear to Hansjee and his colleagues at Fabric that Celsius was not going to make it. The immediate problem for Fabric was that the firm had signed paperwork committing them to invest a further $6 million, imminently. Fabric decided not to throw good money after bad. \u2018Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC\u2019 On July 8, Julien Th\u00e9venard, an associate at Fabric, sent a formal letter to Greenblatt. They were pulling the investment. And they wanted their money back: \u201cRegrettably we are not in a position to proceed with our previous offer of investment. Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC sent on 10th May 2022, which was sent pending closure of our fundraising and allotment of equity.\u201d The meaning of \u2018irrevocably\u2019 At the time, Hansjee probably thought he was doing the right thing. He may have lost $2 million, but at least he had saved the remaining $6 million. How could he possibly be expected to \u201cinvest\u201d in a company that was imminently and publicly going out of business? (He and other Fabric executives involved did not return requests for comment.) Celsius\u2019s debtors-in-possession see it differently, of course. The investment contract between Celsius and Fabric was clear: it committed Fabric to the investment \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Fabric \u201chereby irrevocably applies to subscribe for 391 Preferred B Shares of \u00a30.00001 each in the capital of the Company for cash at a price of $20,469 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions of the articles of association of the Company.\u201d Lawyers for Celsius did not return multiple requests for comment. It is the Celsius debtors\u2019 job to recover as much money as possible in order to pay back as many people as possible. To them, the Fabric contract is simple: You promised to pay us $8 million, and you still owe us $6 million. Where, exactly, is Fabric\u2019s investment? The court will now be asked to decide whether Fabric\u2019s contractual promise to pay is binding, despite the fact that Celsius was collapsing even as it was due. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Before the bankruptcy, Fabric also accused Celsius of mishandling its investment, which had been transmitted in the form of the USDC stablecoin. Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email said Celsius had agreed to keep Fabric\u2019s first $2 million in a \u201csegregated\u201d investment account. But blockchain data showed that the money had immediately been moved to a different wallet. \u201cThe chain data shows that within 24 hrs of confirming receipt of our funds, these were then moved onto \u2018Celsius Network: Wallet 5\u2032,\u201d he wrote. Worse, it was no longer clear where Fabric\u2019s $2 million in stablecoins was now. The USDC had been transferred into \u201can on-chain wallet controlled by Celsius with high volumes of transaction (several hundred thousand transactions), presumably a \u201chot wallet\u201d of Celsius and not a segregated investment account. We note that the USDC balance on this Wallet (\u201dCelsius Network: Wallet 5) is now only 31,367.734793; so the funds have been moved again. We deem this to be a serious breach of the commitment.\u201d The court will therefore have to decide whether Celsius broke the terms of Fabric\u2019s agreement, if it turns out the money was not segregated. Five days after Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email, on July 13, 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy. Fabric has yet to respond to the complaint."

                "body": " Do Kwon is staging a comeback after Terra\u2019s $60 billion collapse. The disgraced CEO of Terraform Labs, whose stablecoin, Terra, collapsed last year, is working on several new products and bulking out his engineering department with new hires. The CEO, wanted by his native South Korea while Interpol seeks his arrest, remains \u201cactively involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm,\u201d Zion Schum, Terraform Labs\u2019 head of communications, confirmed to DL News. This involves \u201call aspects of the strategy and direction of Terraform Labs across all products in development,\u201d said Schum. The rebound attempt from such a persona non grata in crypto is bold \u2013 even in an industry rife with second chances. Terra\u2019s implosion contributed to the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, as well as crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. Terra relaunched its project shortly after the collapse of UST. The new blockchain used the same name but ditched the failed stablecoin \u2013 and prompted suspicions that Kwon could lead the market to yet another failure. While Kwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, South Korean prosecutors have said that Kwon has fled to Serbia. Schum declined to provide Kwon\u2019s location and Kwon could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s an opportunity to work with \u2018the most talented guy in DeFi\u2019 To get the new chain going, the company is hiring for over a dozen roles, including a full-stack engineer and a smart contract developer. Terraform Labs has posted several of these job vacancies after Terra collapsed last May. At least one developer has joined the company since, according to LinkedIn; the TFL spokesperson said that the company now has about 40-50 employees. Earlier this month, Kwon personally discussed potential roles with an interested candidate, who told DL News that it was an opportunity to work with \u201cthe most talented guy in DeFi.\u201d The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on Kwon\u2019s involvement with hiring. Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision Despite the charges against Kwon, Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision rebuilds Terra as a multi-chain \u201clayer 1\u2033 protocol. The company is working on several projects in an attempt to grow the network. In January, Terraform Labs launched an interchain wallet called Station, which has so far secured the support of about two dozen Cosmos-based blockchains. TFL\u2019s new wallet looks a lot like the wallet it produced for the old Terra network and adds support for other Cosmos chains. The TFL spokesperson said it plans to expand Station to Ethereum Virtual Machine chains in the near future. In November, Terraform Labs said it was working on an economic module called Alliance. It allows holders of tokens from chains that have signed up to the Alliance to stake their tokens on another chain. This earns holders extra yields and secures both networks. Participating protocols can choose, via a governance vote, which tokens to accept from other chains in the Alliance. Eligible tokens include native tokens and complex derivatives. Tools from other networks, like Osmosis\u2019s Superfluid Staking, perform somewhat similar services. Yet unlike Superfluid Staking, Alliance does not require stakers to become liquidity providers, sparing them from what\u2019s called impermanent loss. TFL\u2019s purported innovation is that Alliance automates this process, and provides an economic incentive to split yields across blockchains. The ability to trade yields should \u201cattract users, liquidity, and talent from other ecosystems,\u201d said Schum. The company plans to start rolling out Alliance next month. So far, five projects have said they will implement Alliance at launch. Kwon\u2019s third protocol, Feather, makes it easy to spin up new blockchains. These blockchains are backed by validators on the Terra blockchain that opt into Feather, and come with tools like a blockchain explorer and interchain wallet. After this month\u2019s spate of announcements, the price of Terra\u2019s coin, LUNA, shot up from $1.29 to highs of $2.50, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The coin is currently worth about $2.05. Part of the hike could be explained by the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose from $16,669 to $23,282 in the same period. But few people are using Terra, even after the announcements. A dashboard on Flipside Crypto counts just 12,868 users. And after Terra collapsed because of its poor design, of concern is whether TFL\u2019s new tools are any good. Hyungsuk Kang, who worked as a software engineer for Terraform Labs in the second half of 2020 before setting up his own stablecoin protocol, told DL News that TFL employees at the time were inexperienced in blockchain development. Kang said many TFL employees internally discussed the likely failure of their project. That was under Kwon\u2019s leadership, sparking concerns about his return to the TFL, Kang said. Schum declined to comment on the level of experience of TFL employees in the early days of the company. \u2018I don\u2019t think he can repair his image\u2019 Terra may have been Kwon\u2019s second attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin. Kang and other former TFL employees allege that Kwon was behind Basis Cash, a resurrection of a failed algorithmic stablecoin called Basis that had raised $133 million before closing in 2018. The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on these allegations. Alongside running TFL, Kwon must navigate his legal troubles. Serbia does not have an extradition treaty with Kwon\u2019s native Korea but both have previously agreed to requests under the European Convention on Extradition. If Kwon were extradited, legal experts say he could file a legal complaint against Serbia, potentially giving him several years before he has to return. At least two Terraform Labs employees live in Serbia. Neither responded to requests for comment from DL News. That could give Kwon enough time for another bull run \u2013 and another chance to attract novice investors who are unaware of the industry\u2019s prior failures. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can repair his image,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, Korean co-founder of blockchain node validation company Stable Node, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Koreans are] forgiving. It\u2019s more that they are forgetful.\u201d"

                "headline": "Ethena\u2019s $400m USDe token sparks renewed debate over stablecoin label",
                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings.

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations.

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found.

The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Anil Hansjee first expressed worry he was throwing $8 million into a black hole at 7:07 am on the morning of Monday, June 6, 2022, according to his emails. Hansjee is the London-based general partner at Fabric Ventures, a firm that makes investments in crypto startups. He was right to be anxious. Earlier in the year, he had committed to investing $8 million in Celsius, the cryptocurrency exchange. But by June, rumours were spreading that Celsius had been hit by the total collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which wiped about $45 billion off the crypto market. Hansjee wanted to know if his $8 million was going to be safe. His emails have been published as exhibits in the litigation around the bankruptcy of Celsius. The \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d \u2014 the lawyers appointed to recover as much money as possible from the wreckage \u2014 are suing Fabric for $6 million in US federal bankruptcy court. Fabric had paid $2 million of its $8 million investment commitment, but Hansjee and his colleagues refused to pay the remaining $6 million when it became obvious that Celsius was going under. The Celsius debtors now want all the money to be paid. They claim the investment contract Fabric signed remains binding, even if Celsius no longer exists as a functioning company. The investment may be small by crypto VC standards. And the core of the dispute will turn on the dry technicalities of contract law. But the emails give a rare glimpse at the behind-the-scenes panic that unfolds when a VC firm realises it has invested in a crypto company that is going bankrupt and is going to lose all its money. The tone of the emails is both polite and desperate, by turns casually anxious ,and then brutally formal. They also discuss matters that were supposed to be the subject of non-disclosure agreements, the emails state. A difficult and sudden U-turn Back in April 2022, Fabric was bullish on all things crypto and Hansjee couldn\u2019t move fast enough to invest in Celsius. At its peak, Celsius had $12 billion in assets under management. Hansjee practically begged to put money into the company. He wanted to buy $8 million in \u201cseries B\u201d preferred shares but needed time to come up with the cash. Celsius general counsel Ron Deutsch initially told him they were going to stick to their funding deadlines \u2014 which Fabric couldn\u2019t meet. On April 6, Hansjee asked for 90 days to gather the financing. He was happy to sign whatever commitment or contract was required, he said, as long as he was given time to get the cash from his limited partner investors. Deutsch was accommodating: \u201cAs long as we sign the subscription documents/commitments soon we can provide more time for funding,\u201d he told Hansjee. On April 7, Hansjee wrote to Deutsch: \u201cFirstly thanks for your understanding. Highly appreciated. Second, whatever we sign for we are making a HARD commitment for as professionals in this industry. So if we sign for 8m now, even if you were to allow a delayed funding, we would be good for this 8m. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding here and we don\u2019t treat it as an option.\u201d Just two months later, the weather had changed. With cryptocurrency prices in widescale freefall, Hansjee was starting to have doubts. \u2018Tough times I know!!\u2019 On June 6, he emailed Deutsch and Michael Greenblatt, Celsius\u2019s corporate counsel, to ask what was going on. \u201cMichael and Ron how are you? Tough times I know!!\u201d Then he expressed his fears for the first time. \u201cI would like to ask for some investor reporting to be sent our way. Especially in times like this it\u2019s critical to share some insights so we don\u2019t get hung up on social media news which has been overwhelmingly negative to Celsius, unfortunately.\u201d He had meetings with partner investors the following week, he said, \u201cand I will be expected to be able to comment at a high level in our portfolio companies and I\u2019m afraid I have no real insights on key matters such Celsius wrt [with relation to] market impact to $ inflows and AUM [assets under management], expected rev [revenue] and user and AUM growth for the year, timing of the IPO of the mining business in this current market, the CEL token collapse and the UST [stablecoin] story.\u201d \u201cIt would be useful for me to also know what elements are for my ears only,\u201d he wrote. He then noted, also for the first time, that he doubted he could meet a deadline for investing the next $2 million of his $8 million commitment, which was due at the end of the week. \u201cI would like to ask if we can delay this to accommodate a slight delay in our paper work,\u201d he said. He got his meeting with the executives at Celsius but remained worried. \u2018Damn the Torpedoes\u2019 The next day, Celsius posted a long essay on Medium, titled, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,\u201d in which the company argued that \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that vocal actors are spreading misinformation and confusion.\u201d \u201cThey have tried unsuccessfully, for example, to link Celsius to the collapse of Luna and falsely claim that Celsius sustained significant losses as a result,\u201d the company wrote. It also addressed the fact that some customers\u2019 accounts had been frozen \u2014 or placed in \u201cHODL mode\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for them to withdraw their funds. \u201cThey have stirred confusion around HODL mode and the importance of protecting user accounts,\u201d the essay said. Internally, Celsius executives believed they had escaped damage from the Luna fiasco. But customers were nonetheless withdrawing funds from the platform. Celsius\u2019s native token, CEL, had become nearly worthless, creating a potential run on the bank. But denying the rumours in such detail only gave them further life. Customers were freaked out that their accounts were locked as crypto prices crash all through the spring and summer. \u2018Liquidity crisis\u2019 Four days later, on June 10, Hansjee emailed Deutsch and Greenblatt again, requesting an update. This time, Hansjee used the phrase \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d \u2014 suggesting he believed Celsius might not survive. \u201cWhat are the current short term assets (cash and cash equivalents) vs equivalent liabilities? what are current withdrawals and what sort of withdrawal level will lead to a liquidity crisis?\u201d he wrote. On June 13, Celsius froze all customer accounts in an attempt to halt withdrawals so that the platform could be stabilised. Over the next few weeks, it became clear to Hansjee and his colleagues at Fabric that Celsius was not going to make it. The immediate problem for Fabric was that the firm had signed paperwork committing them to invest a further $6 million, imminently. Fabric decided not to throw good money after bad. \u2018Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC\u2019 On July 8, Julien Th\u00e9venard, an associate at Fabric, sent a formal letter to Greenblatt. They were pulling the investment. And they wanted their money back: \u201cRegrettably we are not in a position to proceed with our previous offer of investment. Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC sent on 10th May 2022, which was sent pending closure of our fundraising and allotment of equity.\u201d The meaning of \u2018irrevocably\u2019 At the time, Hansjee probably thought he was doing the right thing. He may have lost $2 million, but at least he had saved the remaining $6 million. How could he possibly be expected to \u201cinvest\u201d in a company that was imminently and publicly going out of business? (He and other Fabric executives involved did not return requests for comment.) Celsius\u2019s debtors-in-possession see it differently, of course. The investment contract between Celsius and Fabric was clear: it committed Fabric to the investment \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Fabric \u201chereby irrevocably applies to subscribe for 391 Preferred B Shares of \u00a30.00001 each in the capital of the Company for cash at a price of $20,469 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions of the articles of association of the Company.\u201d Lawyers for Celsius did not return multiple requests for comment. It is the Celsius debtors\u2019 job to recover as much money as possible in order to pay back as many people as possible. To them, the Fabric contract is simple: You promised to pay us $8 million, and you still owe us $6 million. Where, exactly, is Fabric\u2019s investment? The court will now be asked to decide whether Fabric\u2019s contractual promise to pay is binding, despite the fact that Celsius was collapsing even as it was due. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Before the bankruptcy, Fabric also accused Celsius of mishandling its investment, which had been transmitted in the form of the USDC stablecoin. Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email said Celsius had agreed to keep Fabric\u2019s first $2 million in a \u201csegregated\u201d investment account. But blockchain data showed that the money had immediately been moved to a different wallet. \u201cThe chain data shows that within 24 hrs of confirming receipt of our funds, these were then moved onto \u2018Celsius Network: Wallet 5\u2032,\u201d he wrote. Worse, it was no longer clear where Fabric\u2019s $2 million in stablecoins was now. The USDC had been transferred into \u201can on-chain wallet controlled by Celsius with high volumes of transaction (several hundred thousand transactions), presumably a \u201chot wallet\u201d of Celsius and not a segregated investment account. We note that the USDC balance on this Wallet (\u201dCelsius Network: Wallet 5) is now only 31,367.734793; so the funds have been moved again. We deem this to be a serious breach of the commitment.\u201d The court will therefore have to decide whether Celsius broke the terms of Fabric\u2019s agreement, if it turns out the money was not segregated. Five days after Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email, on July 13, 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy. Fabric has yet to respond to the complaint."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Do Kwon is staging a comeback after Terra\u2019s $60 billion collapse. The disgraced CEO of Terraform Labs, whose stablecoin, Terra, collapsed last year, is working on several new products and bulking out his engineering department with new hires. The CEO, wanted by his native South Korea while Interpol seeks his arrest, remains \u201cactively involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm,\u201d Zion Schum, Terraform Labs\u2019 head of communications, confirmed to DL News. This involves \u201call aspects of the strategy and direction of Terraform Labs across all products in development,\u201d said Schum. The rebound attempt from such a persona non grata in crypto is bold \u2013 even in an industry rife with second chances. Terra\u2019s implosion contributed to the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, as well as crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. Terra relaunched its project shortly after the collapse of UST. The new blockchain used the same name but ditched the failed stablecoin \u2013 and prompted suspicions that Kwon could lead the market to yet another failure. While Kwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, South Korean prosecutors have said that Kwon has fled to Serbia. Schum declined to provide Kwon\u2019s location and Kwon could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s an opportunity to work with \u2018the most talented guy in DeFi\u2019 To get the new chain going, the company is hiring for over a dozen roles, including a full-stack engineer and a smart contract developer. Terraform Labs has posted several of these job vacancies after Terra collapsed last May. At least one developer has joined the company since, according to LinkedIn; the TFL spokesperson said that the company now has about 40-50 employees. Earlier this month, Kwon personally discussed potential roles with an interested candidate, who told DL News that it was an opportunity to work with \u201cthe most talented guy in DeFi.\u201d The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on Kwon\u2019s involvement with hiring. Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision Despite the charges against Kwon, Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision rebuilds Terra as a multi-chain \u201clayer 1\u2033 protocol. The company is working on several projects in an attempt to grow the network. In January, Terraform Labs launched an interchain wallet called Station, which has so far secured the support of about two dozen Cosmos-based blockchains. TFL\u2019s new wallet looks a lot like the wallet it produced for the old Terra network and adds support for other Cosmos chains. The TFL spokesperson said it plans to expand Station to Ethereum Virtual Machine chains in the near future. In November, Terraform Labs said it was working on an economic module called Alliance. It allows holders of tokens from chains that have signed up to the Alliance to stake their tokens on another chain. This earns holders extra yields and secures both networks. Participating protocols can choose, via a governance vote, which tokens to accept from other chains in the Alliance. Eligible tokens include native tokens and complex derivatives. Tools from other networks, like Osmosis\u2019s Superfluid Staking, perform somewhat similar services. Yet unlike Superfluid Staking, Alliance does not require stakers to become liquidity providers, sparing them from what\u2019s called impermanent loss. TFL\u2019s purported innovation is that Alliance automates this process, and provides an economic incentive to split yields across blockchains. The ability to trade yields should \u201cattract users, liquidity, and talent from other ecosystems,\u201d said Schum. The company plans to start rolling out Alliance next month. So far, five projects have said they will implement Alliance at launch. Kwon\u2019s third protocol, Feather, makes it easy to spin up new blockchains. These blockchains are backed by validators on the Terra blockchain that opt into Feather, and come with tools like a blockchain explorer and interchain wallet. After this month\u2019s spate of announcements, the price of Terra\u2019s coin, LUNA, shot up from $1.29 to highs of $2.50, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The coin is currently worth about $2.05. Part of the hike could be explained by the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose from $16,669 to $23,282 in the same period. But few people are using Terra, even after the announcements. A dashboard on Flipside Crypto counts just 12,868 users. And after Terra collapsed because of its poor design, of concern is whether TFL\u2019s new tools are any good. Hyungsuk Kang, who worked as a software engineer for Terraform Labs in the second half of 2020 before setting up his own stablecoin protocol, told DL News that TFL employees at the time were inexperienced in blockchain development. Kang said many TFL employees internally discussed the likely failure of their project. That was under Kwon\u2019s leadership, sparking concerns about his return to the TFL, Kang said. Schum declined to comment on the level of experience of TFL employees in the early days of the company. \u2018I don\u2019t think he can repair his image\u2019 Terra may have been Kwon\u2019s second attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin. Kang and other former TFL employees allege that Kwon was behind Basis Cash, a resurrection of a failed algorithmic stablecoin called Basis that had raised $133 million before closing in 2018. The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on these allegations. Alongside running TFL, Kwon must navigate his legal troubles. Serbia does not have an extradition treaty with Kwon\u2019s native Korea but both have previously agreed to requests under the European Convention on Extradition. If Kwon were extradited, legal experts say he could file a legal complaint against Serbia, potentially giving him several years before he has to return. At least two Terraform Labs employees live in Serbia. Neither responded to requests for comment from DL News. That could give Kwon enough time for another bull run \u2013 and another chance to attract novice investors who are unaware of the industry\u2019s prior failures. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can repair his image,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, Korean co-founder of blockchain node validation company Stable Node, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Koreans are] forgiving. It\u2019s more that they are forgetful.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets.

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Anil Hansjee first expressed worry he was throwing $8 million into a black hole at 7:07 am on the morning of Monday, June 6, 2022, according to his emails. Hansjee is the London-based general partner at Fabric Ventures, a firm that makes investments in crypto startups. He was right to be anxious. Earlier in the year, he had committed to investing $8 million in Celsius, the cryptocurrency exchange. But by June, rumours were spreading that Celsius had been hit by the total collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which wiped about $45 billion off the crypto market. Hansjee wanted to know if his $8 million was going to be safe. His emails have been published as exhibits in the litigation around the bankruptcy of Celsius. The \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d \u2014 the lawyers appointed to recover as much money as possible from the wreckage \u2014 are suing Fabric for $6 million in US federal bankruptcy court. Fabric had paid $2 million of its $8 million investment commitment, but Hansjee and his colleagues refused to pay the remaining $6 million when it became obvious that Celsius was going under. The Celsius debtors now want all the money to be paid. They claim the investment contract Fabric signed remains binding, even if Celsius no longer exists as a functioning company. The investment may be small by crypto VC standards. And the core of the dispute will turn on the dry technicalities of contract law. But the emails give a rare glimpse at the behind-the-scenes panic that unfolds when a VC firm realises it has invested in a crypto company that is going bankrupt and is going to lose all its money. The tone of the emails is both polite and desperate, by turns casually anxious ,and then brutally formal. They also discuss matters that were supposed to be the subject of non-disclosure agreements, the emails state. A difficult and sudden U-turn Back in April 2022, Fabric was bullish on all things crypto and Hansjee couldn\u2019t move fast enough to invest in Celsius. At its peak, Celsius had $12 billion in assets under management. Hansjee practically begged to put money into the company. He wanted to buy $8 million in \u201cseries B\u201d preferred shares but needed time to come up with the cash. Celsius general counsel Ron Deutsch initially told him they were going to stick to their funding deadlines \u2014 which Fabric couldn\u2019t meet. On April 6, Hansjee asked for 90 days to gather the financing. He was happy to sign whatever commitment or contract was required, he said, as long as he was given time to get the cash from his limited partner investors. Deutsch was accommodating: \u201cAs long as we sign the subscription documents/commitments soon we can provide more time for funding,\u201d he told Hansjee. On April 7, Hansjee wrote to Deutsch: \u201cFirstly thanks for your understanding. Highly appreciated. Second, whatever we sign for we are making a HARD commitment for as professionals in this industry. So if we sign for 8m now, even if you were to allow a delayed funding, we would be good for this 8m. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding here and we don\u2019t treat it as an option.\u201d Just two months later, the weather had changed. With cryptocurrency prices in widescale freefall, Hansjee was starting to have doubts. \u2018Tough times I know!!\u2019 On June 6, he emailed Deutsch and Michael Greenblatt, Celsius\u2019s corporate counsel, to ask what was going on. \u201cMichael and Ron how are you? Tough times I know!!\u201d Then he expressed his fears for the first time. \u201cI would like to ask for some investor reporting to be sent our way. Especially in times like this it\u2019s critical to share some insights so we don\u2019t get hung up on social media news which has been overwhelmingly negative to Celsius, unfortunately.\u201d He had meetings with partner investors the following week, he said, \u201cand I will be expected to be able to comment at a high level in our portfolio companies and I\u2019m afraid I have no real insights on key matters such Celsius wrt [with relation to] market impact to $ inflows and AUM [assets under management], expected rev [revenue] and user and AUM growth for the year, timing of the IPO of the mining business in this current market, the CEL token collapse and the UST [stablecoin] story.\u201d \u201cIt would be useful for me to also know what elements are for my ears only,\u201d he wrote. He then noted, also for the first time, that he doubted he could meet a deadline for investing the next $2 million of his $8 million commitment, which was due at the end of the week. \u201cI would like to ask if we can delay this to accommodate a slight delay in our paper work,\u201d he said. He got his meeting with the executives at Celsius but remained worried. \u2018Damn the Torpedoes\u2019 The next day, Celsius posted a long essay on Medium, titled, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,\u201d in which the company argued that \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that vocal actors are spreading misinformation and confusion.\u201d \u201cThey have tried unsuccessfully, for example, to link Celsius to the collapse of Luna and falsely claim that Celsius sustained significant losses as a result,\u201d the company wrote. It also addressed the fact that some customers\u2019 accounts had been frozen \u2014 or placed in \u201cHODL mode\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for them to withdraw their funds. \u201cThey have stirred confusion around HODL mode and the importance of protecting user accounts,\u201d the essay said. Internally, Celsius executives believed they had escaped damage from the Luna fiasco. But customers were nonetheless withdrawing funds from the platform. Celsius\u2019s native token, CEL, had become nearly worthless, creating a potential run on the bank. But denying the rumours in such detail only gave them further life. Customers were freaked out that their accounts were locked as crypto prices crash all through the spring and summer. \u2018Liquidity crisis\u2019 Four days later, on June 10, Hansjee emailed Deutsch and Greenblatt again, requesting an update. This time, Hansjee used the phrase \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d \u2014 suggesting he believed Celsius might not survive. \u201cWhat are the current short term assets (cash and cash equivalents) vs equivalent liabilities? what are current withdrawals and what sort of withdrawal level will lead to a liquidity crisis?\u201d he wrote. On June 13, Celsius froze all customer accounts in an attempt to halt withdrawals so that the platform could be stabilised. Over the next few weeks, it became clear to Hansjee and his colleagues at Fabric that Celsius was not going to make it. The immediate problem for Fabric was that the firm had signed paperwork committing them to invest a further $6 million, imminently. Fabric decided not to throw good money after bad. \u2018Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC\u2019 On July 8, Julien Th\u00e9venard, an associate at Fabric, sent a formal letter to Greenblatt. They were pulling the investment. And they wanted their money back: \u201cRegrettably we are not in a position to proceed with our previous offer of investment. Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC sent on 10th May 2022, which was sent pending closure of our fundraising and allotment of equity.\u201d The meaning of \u2018irrevocably\u2019 At the time, Hansjee probably thought he was doing the right thing. He may have lost $2 million, but at least he had saved the remaining $6 million. How could he possibly be expected to \u201cinvest\u201d in a company that was imminently and publicly going out of business? (He and other Fabric executives involved did not return requests for comment.) Celsius\u2019s debtors-in-possession see it differently, of course. The investment contract between Celsius and Fabric was clear: it committed Fabric to the investment \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Fabric \u201chereby irrevocably applies to subscribe for 391 Preferred B Shares of \u00a30.00001 each in the capital of the Company for cash at a price of $20,469 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions of the articles of association of the Company.\u201d Lawyers for Celsius did not return multiple requests for comment. It is the Celsius debtors\u2019 job to recover as much money as possible in order to pay back as many people as possible. To them, the Fabric contract is simple: You promised to pay us $8 million, and you still owe us $6 million. Where, exactly, is Fabric\u2019s investment? The court will now be asked to decide whether Fabric\u2019s contractual promise to pay is binding, despite the fact that Celsius was collapsing even as it was due. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Before the bankruptcy, Fabric also accused Celsius of mishandling its investment, which had been transmitted in the form of the USDC stablecoin. Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email said Celsius had agreed to keep Fabric\u2019s first $2 million in a \u201csegregated\u201d investment account. But blockchain data showed that the money had immediately been moved to a different wallet. \u201cThe chain data shows that within 24 hrs of confirming receipt of our funds, these were then moved onto \u2018Celsius Network: Wallet 5\u2032,\u201d he wrote. Worse, it was no longer clear where Fabric\u2019s $2 million in stablecoins was now. The USDC had been transferred into \u201can on-chain wallet controlled by Celsius with high volumes of transaction (several hundred thousand transactions), presumably a \u201chot wallet\u201d of Celsius and not a segregated investment account. We note that the USDC balance on this Wallet (\u201dCelsius Network: Wallet 5) is now only 31,367.734793; so the funds have been moved again. We deem this to be a serious breach of the commitment.\u201d The court will therefore have to decide whether Celsius broke the terms of Fabric\u2019s agreement, if it turns out the money was not segregated. Five days after Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email, on July 13, 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy. Fabric has yet to respond to the complaint."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Do Kwon is staging a comeback after Terra\u2019s $60 billion collapse. The disgraced CEO of Terraform Labs, whose stablecoin, Terra, collapsed last year, is working on several new products and bulking out his engineering department with new hires. The CEO, wanted by his native South Korea while Interpol seeks his arrest, remains \u201cactively involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm,\u201d Zion Schum, Terraform Labs\u2019 head of communications, confirmed to DL News. This involves \u201call aspects of the strategy and direction of Terraform Labs across all products in development,\u201d said Schum. The rebound attempt from such a persona non grata in crypto is bold \u2013 even in an industry rife with second chances. Terra\u2019s implosion contributed to the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, as well as crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. Terra relaunched its project shortly after the collapse of UST. The new blockchain used the same name but ditched the failed stablecoin \u2013 and prompted suspicions that Kwon could lead the market to yet another failure. While Kwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, South Korean prosecutors have said that Kwon has fled to Serbia. Schum declined to provide Kwon\u2019s location and Kwon could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s an opportunity to work with \u2018the most talented guy in DeFi\u2019 To get the new chain going, the company is hiring for over a dozen roles, including a full-stack engineer and a smart contract developer. Terraform Labs has posted several of these job vacancies after Terra collapsed last May. At least one developer has joined the company since, according to LinkedIn; the TFL spokesperson said that the company now has about 40-50 employees. Earlier this month, Kwon personally discussed potential roles with an interested candidate, who told DL News that it was an opportunity to work with \u201cthe most talented guy in DeFi.\u201d The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on Kwon\u2019s involvement with hiring. Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision Despite the charges against Kwon, Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision rebuilds Terra as a multi-chain \u201clayer 1\u2033 protocol. The company is working on several projects in an attempt to grow the network. In January, Terraform Labs launched an interchain wallet called Station, which has so far secured the support of about two dozen Cosmos-based blockchains. TFL\u2019s new wallet looks a lot like the wallet it produced for the old Terra network and adds support for other Cosmos chains. The TFL spokesperson said it plans to expand Station to Ethereum Virtual Machine chains in the near future. In November, Terraform Labs said it was working on an economic module called Alliance. It allows holders of tokens from chains that have signed up to the Alliance to stake their tokens on another chain. This earns holders extra yields and secures both networks. Participating protocols can choose, via a governance vote, which tokens to accept from other chains in the Alliance. Eligible tokens include native tokens and complex derivatives. Tools from other networks, like Osmosis\u2019s Superfluid Staking, perform somewhat similar services. Yet unlike Superfluid Staking, Alliance does not require stakers to become liquidity providers, sparing them from what\u2019s called impermanent loss. TFL\u2019s purported innovation is that Alliance automates this process, and provides an economic incentive to split yields across blockchains. The ability to trade yields should \u201cattract users, liquidity, and talent from other ecosystems,\u201d said Schum. The company plans to start rolling out Alliance next month. So far, five projects have said they will implement Alliance at launch. Kwon\u2019s third protocol, Feather, makes it easy to spin up new blockchains. These blockchains are backed by validators on the Terra blockchain that opt into Feather, and come with tools like a blockchain explorer and interchain wallet. After this month\u2019s spate of announcements, the price of Terra\u2019s coin, LUNA, shot up from $1.29 to highs of $2.50, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The coin is currently worth about $2.05. Part of the hike could be explained by the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose from $16,669 to $23,282 in the same period. But few people are using Terra, even after the announcements. A dashboard on Flipside Crypto counts just 12,868 users. And after Terra collapsed because of its poor design, of concern is whether TFL\u2019s new tools are any good. Hyungsuk Kang, who worked as a software engineer for Terraform Labs in the second half of 2020 before setting up his own stablecoin protocol, told DL News that TFL employees at the time were inexperienced in blockchain development. Kang said many TFL employees internally discussed the likely failure of their project. That was under Kwon\u2019s leadership, sparking concerns about his return to the TFL, Kang said. Schum declined to comment on the level of experience of TFL employees in the early days of the company. \u2018I don\u2019t think he can repair his image\u2019 Terra may have been Kwon\u2019s second attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin. Kang and other former TFL employees allege that Kwon was behind Basis Cash, a resurrection of a failed algorithmic stablecoin called Basis that had raised $133 million before closing in 2018. The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on these allegations. Alongside running TFL, Kwon must navigate his legal troubles. Serbia does not have an extradition treaty with Kwon\u2019s native Korea but both have previously agreed to requests under the European Convention on Extradition. If Kwon were extradited, legal experts say he could file a legal complaint against Serbia, potentially giving him several years before he has to return. At least two Terraform Labs employees live in Serbia. Neither responded to requests for comment from DL News. That could give Kwon enough time for another bull run \u2013 and another chance to attract novice investors who are unaware of the industry\u2019s prior failures. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can repair his image,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, Korean co-founder of blockchain node validation company Stable Node, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Koreans are] forgiving. It\u2019s more that they are forgetful.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported.

                "body": " Anil Hansjee first expressed worry he was throwing $8 million into a black hole at 7:07 am on the morning of Monday, June 6, 2022, according to his emails. Hansjee is the London-based general partner at Fabric Ventures, a firm that makes investments in crypto startups. He was right to be anxious. Earlier in the year, he had committed to investing $8 million in Celsius, the cryptocurrency exchange. But by June, rumours were spreading that Celsius had been hit by the total collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which wiped about $45 billion off the crypto market. Hansjee wanted to know if his $8 million was going to be safe. His emails have been published as exhibits in the litigation around the bankruptcy of Celsius. The \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d \u2014 the lawyers appointed to recover as much money as possible from the wreckage \u2014 are suing Fabric for $6 million in US federal bankruptcy court. Fabric had paid $2 million of its $8 million investment commitment, but Hansjee and his colleagues refused to pay the remaining $6 million when it became obvious that Celsius was going under. The Celsius debtors now want all the money to be paid. They claim the investment contract Fabric signed remains binding, even if Celsius no longer exists as a functioning company. The investment may be small by crypto VC standards. And the core of the dispute will turn on the dry technicalities of contract law. But the emails give a rare glimpse at the behind-the-scenes panic that unfolds when a VC firm realises it has invested in a crypto company that is going bankrupt and is going to lose all its money. The tone of the emails is both polite and desperate, by turns casually anxious ,and then brutally formal. They also discuss matters that were supposed to be the subject of non-disclosure agreements, the emails state. A difficult and sudden U-turn Back in April 2022, Fabric was bullish on all things crypto and Hansjee couldn\u2019t move fast enough to invest in Celsius. At its peak, Celsius had $12 billion in assets under management. Hansjee practically begged to put money into the company. He wanted to buy $8 million in \u201cseries B\u201d preferred shares but needed time to come up with the cash. Celsius general counsel Ron Deutsch initially told him they were going to stick to their funding deadlines \u2014 which Fabric couldn\u2019t meet. On April 6, Hansjee asked for 90 days to gather the financing. He was happy to sign whatever commitment or contract was required, he said, as long as he was given time to get the cash from his limited partner investors. Deutsch was accommodating: \u201cAs long as we sign the subscription documents/commitments soon we can provide more time for funding,\u201d he told Hansjee. On April 7, Hansjee wrote to Deutsch: \u201cFirstly thanks for your understanding. Highly appreciated. Second, whatever we sign for we are making a HARD commitment for as professionals in this industry. So if we sign for 8m now, even if you were to allow a delayed funding, we would be good for this 8m. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding here and we don\u2019t treat it as an option.\u201d Just two months later, the weather had changed. With cryptocurrency prices in widescale freefall, Hansjee was starting to have doubts. \u2018Tough times I know!!\u2019 On June 6, he emailed Deutsch and Michael Greenblatt, Celsius\u2019s corporate counsel, to ask what was going on. \u201cMichael and Ron how are you? Tough times I know!!\u201d Then he expressed his fears for the first time. \u201cI would like to ask for some investor reporting to be sent our way. Especially in times like this it\u2019s critical to share some insights so we don\u2019t get hung up on social media news which has been overwhelmingly negative to Celsius, unfortunately.\u201d He had meetings with partner investors the following week, he said, \u201cand I will be expected to be able to comment at a high level in our portfolio companies and I\u2019m afraid I have no real insights on key matters such Celsius wrt [with relation to] market impact to $ inflows and AUM [assets under management], expected rev [revenue] and user and AUM growth for the year, timing of the IPO of the mining business in this current market, the CEL token collapse and the UST [stablecoin] story.\u201d \u201cIt would be useful for me to also know what elements are for my ears only,\u201d he wrote. He then noted, also for the first time, that he doubted he could meet a deadline for investing the next $2 million of his $8 million commitment, which was due at the end of the week. \u201cI would like to ask if we can delay this to accommodate a slight delay in our paper work,\u201d he said. He got his meeting with the executives at Celsius but remained worried. \u2018Damn the Torpedoes\u2019 The next day, Celsius posted a long essay on Medium, titled, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,\u201d in which the company argued that \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that vocal actors are spreading misinformation and confusion.\u201d \u201cThey have tried unsuccessfully, for example, to link Celsius to the collapse of Luna and falsely claim that Celsius sustained significant losses as a result,\u201d the company wrote. It also addressed the fact that some customers\u2019 accounts had been frozen \u2014 or placed in \u201cHODL mode\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for them to withdraw their funds. \u201cThey have stirred confusion around HODL mode and the importance of protecting user accounts,\u201d the essay said. Internally, Celsius executives believed they had escaped damage from the Luna fiasco. But customers were nonetheless withdrawing funds from the platform. Celsius\u2019s native token, CEL, had become nearly worthless, creating a potential run on the bank. But denying the rumours in such detail only gave them further life. Customers were freaked out that their accounts were locked as crypto prices crash all through the spring and summer. \u2018Liquidity crisis\u2019 Four days later, on June 10, Hansjee emailed Deutsch and Greenblatt again, requesting an update. This time, Hansjee used the phrase \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d \u2014 suggesting he believed Celsius might not survive. \u201cWhat are the current short term assets (cash and cash equivalents) vs equivalent liabilities? what are current withdrawals and what sort of withdrawal level will lead to a liquidity crisis?\u201d he wrote. On June 13, Celsius froze all customer accounts in an attempt to halt withdrawals so that the platform could be stabilised. Over the next few weeks, it became clear to Hansjee and his colleagues at Fabric that Celsius was not going to make it. The immediate problem for Fabric was that the firm had signed paperwork committing them to invest a further $6 million, imminently. Fabric decided not to throw good money after bad. \u2018Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC\u2019 On July 8, Julien Th\u00e9venard, an associate at Fabric, sent a formal letter to Greenblatt. They were pulling the investment. And they wanted their money back: \u201cRegrettably we are not in a position to proceed with our previous offer of investment. Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC sent on 10th May 2022, which was sent pending closure of our fundraising and allotment of equity.\u201d The meaning of \u2018irrevocably\u2019 At the time, Hansjee probably thought he was doing the right thing. He may have lost $2 million, but at least he had saved the remaining $6 million. How could he possibly be expected to \u201cinvest\u201d in a company that was imminently and publicly going out of business? (He and other Fabric executives involved did not return requests for comment.) Celsius\u2019s debtors-in-possession see it differently, of course. The investment contract between Celsius and Fabric was clear: it committed Fabric to the investment \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Fabric \u201chereby irrevocably applies to subscribe for 391 Preferred B Shares of \u00a30.00001 each in the capital of the Company for cash at a price of $20,469 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions of the articles of association of the Company.\u201d Lawyers for Celsius did not return multiple requests for comment. It is the Celsius debtors\u2019 job to recover as much money as possible in order to pay back as many people as possible. To them, the Fabric contract is simple: You promised to pay us $8 million, and you still owe us $6 million. Where, exactly, is Fabric\u2019s investment? The court will now be asked to decide whether Fabric\u2019s contractual promise to pay is binding, despite the fact that Celsius was collapsing even as it was due. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Before the bankruptcy, Fabric also accused Celsius of mishandling its investment, which had been transmitted in the form of the USDC stablecoin. Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email said Celsius had agreed to keep Fabric\u2019s first $2 million in a \u201csegregated\u201d investment account. But blockchain data showed that the money had immediately been moved to a different wallet. \u201cThe chain data shows that within 24 hrs of confirming receipt of our funds, these were then moved onto \u2018Celsius Network: Wallet 5\u2032,\u201d he wrote. Worse, it was no longer clear where Fabric\u2019s $2 million in stablecoins was now. The USDC had been transferred into \u201can on-chain wallet controlled by Celsius with high volumes of transaction (several hundred thousand transactions), presumably a \u201chot wallet\u201d of Celsius and not a segregated investment account. We note that the USDC balance on this Wallet (\u201dCelsius Network: Wallet 5) is now only 31,367.734793; so the funds have been moved again. We deem this to be a serious breach of the commitment.\u201d The court will therefore have to decide whether Celsius broke the terms of Fabric\u2019s agreement, if it turns out the money was not segregated. Five days after Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email, on July 13, 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy. Fabric has yet to respond to the complaint."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Do Kwon is staging a comeback after Terra\u2019s $60 billion collapse. The disgraced CEO of Terraform Labs, whose stablecoin, Terra, collapsed last year, is working on several new products and bulking out his engineering department with new hires. The CEO, wanted by his native South Korea while Interpol seeks his arrest, remains \u201cactively involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm,\u201d Zion Schum, Terraform Labs\u2019 head of communications, confirmed to DL News. This involves \u201call aspects of the strategy and direction of Terraform Labs across all products in development,\u201d said Schum. The rebound attempt from such a persona non grata in crypto is bold \u2013 even in an industry rife with second chances. Terra\u2019s implosion contributed to the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, as well as crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. Terra relaunched its project shortly after the collapse of UST. The new blockchain used the same name but ditched the failed stablecoin \u2013 and prompted suspicions that Kwon could lead the market to yet another failure. While Kwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, South Korean prosecutors have said that Kwon has fled to Serbia. Schum declined to provide Kwon\u2019s location and Kwon could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s an opportunity to work with \u2018the most talented guy in DeFi\u2019 To get the new chain going, the company is hiring for over a dozen roles, including a full-stack engineer and a smart contract developer. Terraform Labs has posted several of these job vacancies after Terra collapsed last May. At least one developer has joined the company since, according to LinkedIn; the TFL spokesperson said that the company now has about 40-50 employees. Earlier this month, Kwon personally discussed potential roles with an interested candidate, who told DL News that it was an opportunity to work with \u201cthe most talented guy in DeFi.\u201d The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on Kwon\u2019s involvement with hiring. Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision Despite the charges against Kwon, Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision rebuilds Terra as a multi-chain \u201clayer 1\u2033 protocol. The company is working on several projects in an attempt to grow the network. In January, Terraform Labs launched an interchain wallet called Station, which has so far secured the support of about two dozen Cosmos-based blockchains. TFL\u2019s new wallet looks a lot like the wallet it produced for the old Terra network and adds support for other Cosmos chains. The TFL spokesperson said it plans to expand Station to Ethereum Virtual Machine chains in the near future. In November, Terraform Labs said it was working on an economic module called Alliance. It allows holders of tokens from chains that have signed up to the Alliance to stake their tokens on another chain. This earns holders extra yields and secures both networks. Participating protocols can choose, via a governance vote, which tokens to accept from other chains in the Alliance. Eligible tokens include native tokens and complex derivatives. Tools from other networks, like Osmosis\u2019s Superfluid Staking, perform somewhat similar services. Yet unlike Superfluid Staking, Alliance does not require stakers to become liquidity providers, sparing them from what\u2019s called impermanent loss. TFL\u2019s purported innovation is that Alliance automates this process, and provides an economic incentive to split yields across blockchains. The ability to trade yields should \u201cattract users, liquidity, and talent from other ecosystems,\u201d said Schum. The company plans to start rolling out Alliance next month. So far, five projects have said they will implement Alliance at launch. Kwon\u2019s third protocol, Feather, makes it easy to spin up new blockchains. These blockchains are backed by validators on the Terra blockchain that opt into Feather, and come with tools like a blockchain explorer and interchain wallet. After this month\u2019s spate of announcements, the price of Terra\u2019s coin, LUNA, shot up from $1.29 to highs of $2.50, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The coin is currently worth about $2.05. Part of the hike could be explained by the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose from $16,669 to $23,282 in the same period. But few people are using Terra, even after the announcements. A dashboard on Flipside Crypto counts just 12,868 users. And after Terra collapsed because of its poor design, of concern is whether TFL\u2019s new tools are any good. Hyungsuk Kang, who worked as a software engineer for Terraform Labs in the second half of 2020 before setting up his own stablecoin protocol, told DL News that TFL employees at the time were inexperienced in blockchain development. Kang said many TFL employees internally discussed the likely failure of their project. That was under Kwon\u2019s leadership, sparking concerns about his return to the TFL, Kang said. Schum declined to comment on the level of experience of TFL employees in the early days of the company. \u2018I don\u2019t think he can repair his image\u2019 Terra may have been Kwon\u2019s second attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin. Kang and other former TFL employees allege that Kwon was behind Basis Cash, a resurrection of a failed algorithmic stablecoin called Basis that had raised $133 million before closing in 2018. The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on these allegations. Alongside running TFL, Kwon must navigate his legal troubles. Serbia does not have an extradition treaty with Kwon\u2019s native Korea but both have previously agreed to requests under the European Convention on Extradition. If Kwon were extradited, legal experts say he could file a legal complaint against Serbia, potentially giving him several years before he has to return. At least two Terraform Labs employees live in Serbia. Neither responded to requests for comment from DL News. That could give Kwon enough time for another bull run \u2013 and another chance to attract novice investors who are unaware of the industry\u2019s prior failures. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can repair his image,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, Korean co-founder of blockchain node validation company Stable Node, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Koreans are] forgiving. It\u2019s more that they are forgetful.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "headline": "The SEC\u2019s Do Kwon case has massive implications for crypto\u2019s legal future",
                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " The US Securities and Exchange Commission outlined an expansive new view of its jurisdiction over crypto assets in the lawsuit it filed late last week against Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, who is currently on the run from Interpol. While the international manhunt for Kwon continues \u2014 he is suspected of being in Serbia or possibly Switzerland \u2014 the SEC\u2019s lawsuit gives a number of clues as to its current enforcement priorities. Most notably, the SEC continues to expand its view of what counts as a \u201csecurity.\u201d The entire complaint against Kwon is a lesson in the definition of \u201cthe Howey test\u201d, the legal definition of what counts as an investment that must be compliant with US law on assets like stocks and bonds. It also shows that the SEC is becoming more sophisticated in its coverage of crypto and, at the same time, less tolerant of allegedly unfair dealings in digital assets. This is potentially explosive for algorithmic stablecoins because they can be swapped for cryptocurrencies supposed to back them The collapse of Kwon\u2019s TerraUSD stablecoin last year wiped out $40 billion, the complaint claims. TerraUSD (UST) maintained its parity with the dollar via an algorithmic relationship with Terra\u2019s native cryptocurrency, LUNA. Behind the two-way relationship was an arbitrage opportunity every time UST lost its peg in either direction. But they went into a death spiral after continuous selling of both tokens. The collapse started a contagion, and losses impacted Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Genesis and Digital Currency Group, and the FTX/ Alameda Research empire. One of the attractions of the Terra blockchain was its alleged relationship with Chai, a Korean mobile retail payments service that offered consumers the ability to buy things at shops and cinemas, with the transactions settled on the Terra blockchain. NOW READ: Gensler\u2019s history hints at what\u2019s coming next in the crypto crackdown However, the SEC claims that in reality, the payments were settled the traditional way, in online banking cash, and the company then \u201cdeceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain,\u201d as if they were happening on that chain when they were not, the complaint alleges. The SEC says it can prove this because it examined the timing of the blockchain transactions against the actual transactions on Chai: They were not the same. The complaint also alleges, for the first time, that a stablecoin is a security \u2013 in this case the stablecoin is UST. The intended purpose of stablecoins is to provide a crypto asset that exactly matches the value of a regular currency, usually US dollars. At first glance, stablecoins aren\u2019t like stocks or bonds because they more closely resemble traditional forms of electronic cash. So it will be controversial if the SEC insists in the US courts that stablecoins are akin to traditional investment \u201csecurities\u201d that fall under its jurisdiction. The SEC\u2019s main argument against stablecoins is that Terraform made UST available on its Anchor protocol. That platform offered \u201cinterest\u201d payments of 19% to 20%, to anyone willing to loan their UST to borrowers on the protocol. Thus UST functioned like a security offering profits in the future. Further, the SEC claims, UST was security because owning it gave users the right to swap it for Luna, the cryptocurrency whose supply was meant to back UST\u2019s peg to the dollar. \u201cGiven that UST investors had the right to convert UST to one dollar\u2019s worth of LUNA via Terra, investors who bought UST had the right to subscribe to or purchase a security,\u201d the suit says. This is potentially explosive for algorithmic stablecoins because they can be swapped for cryptocurrencies supposed to back them. In the case, the SEC claims that \u201cwrapped Luna\u201d (wLUNA) functioned as a \u201creceipt\u201d for a security. Tokens become \u201cwrapped\u201d when their \u201ctoken standards\u201d \u2013 the underlying technical details \u2013 are changed so that they fit better with another part of the blockchain or indeed another blockchain. In the case of wrapping across different blockchains, the token is disabled on the origin blockchain and a new token representing its exact value is created on the destination chain, via a \u201cwrap.\u201d The SEC is alleging that creating a wrapped version of a token when you move it from one chain to another is the same thing as generating a receipt for a security trade. The SEC has not made this argument before. Perhaps more obviously, the SEC is also making the case that Terraform\u2019s \u201cmAsset\u201d token \u2014 which algorithmically tracked traditional stocks \u2014 was also a security, because it worked like a swap in traditional finance. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly in terms of future enforcement, the SEC outlines its logic for intervening aggressively in crypto. It is very concerned with cases in which domestic retail investors lose their life savings. The suit contains a number of anecdotes about ordinary people who lost a lot of money on Luna and UST: \u201cFor example, a pharmacist in California borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to purchase UST and lost his entire investment,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cA painter in Vermont invested $20,000 in UST set aside for his son\u2019s college education, but lost it all when the Terraform ecosystem collapsed.\u201d NOW READ: How Coinbase used Slack to sniff out its insider trader The SEC has signalled this to the markets before, but the signal was contained in a booklet that is little-read by crypto market participants: The \u201c2023 Examination Priorities\u201d report from the SEC\u2019s Division of Examinations. \u201cThe division will continue to monitor and, when appropriate, conduct examinations of potentially impacted or affected registrants,\u201d it says. Most ominously for crypto, the SEC said it intended to wade further into new waters: \u201cThe division will focus on new or never-before examined registrants offering crypto or crypto-related assets.\u201d Editor\u2019s note (February 21, 2023): This story has been updated with a revised paragraph to explain how TerraUSD functioned."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Anil Hansjee first expressed worry he was throwing $8 million into a black hole at 7:07 am on the morning of Monday, June 6, 2022, according to his emails. Hansjee is the London-based general partner at Fabric Ventures, a firm that makes investments in crypto startups. He was right to be anxious. Earlier in the year, he had committed to investing $8 million in Celsius, the cryptocurrency exchange. But by June, rumours were spreading that Celsius had been hit by the total collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which wiped about $45 billion off the crypto market. Hansjee wanted to know if his $8 million was going to be safe. His emails have been published as exhibits in the litigation around the bankruptcy of Celsius. The \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d \u2014 the lawyers appointed to recover as much money as possible from the wreckage \u2014 are suing Fabric for $6 million in US federal bankruptcy court. Fabric had paid $2 million of its $8 million investment commitment, but Hansjee and his colleagues refused to pay the remaining $6 million when it became obvious that Celsius was going under. The Celsius debtors now want all the money to be paid. They claim the investment contract Fabric signed remains binding, even if Celsius no longer exists as a functioning company. The investment may be small by crypto VC standards. And the core of the dispute will turn on the dry technicalities of contract law. But the emails give a rare glimpse at the behind-the-scenes panic that unfolds when a VC firm realises it has invested in a crypto company that is going bankrupt and is going to lose all its money. The tone of the emails is both polite and desperate, by turns casually anxious ,and then brutally formal. They also discuss matters that were supposed to be the subject of non-disclosure agreements, the emails state. A difficult and sudden U-turn Back in April 2022, Fabric was bullish on all things crypto and Hansjee couldn\u2019t move fast enough to invest in Celsius. At its peak, Celsius had $12 billion in assets under management. Hansjee practically begged to put money into the company. He wanted to buy $8 million in \u201cseries B\u201d preferred shares but needed time to come up with the cash. Celsius general counsel Ron Deutsch initially told him they were going to stick to their funding deadlines \u2014 which Fabric couldn\u2019t meet. On April 6, Hansjee asked for 90 days to gather the financing. He was happy to sign whatever commitment or contract was required, he said, as long as he was given time to get the cash from his limited partner investors. Deutsch was accommodating: \u201cAs long as we sign the subscription documents/commitments soon we can provide more time for funding,\u201d he told Hansjee. On April 7, Hansjee wrote to Deutsch: \u201cFirstly thanks for your understanding. Highly appreciated. Second, whatever we sign for we are making a HARD commitment for as professionals in this industry. So if we sign for 8m now, even if you were to allow a delayed funding, we would be good for this 8m. I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding here and we don\u2019t treat it as an option.\u201d Just two months later, the weather had changed. With cryptocurrency prices in widescale freefall, Hansjee was starting to have doubts. \u2018Tough times I know!!\u2019 On June 6, he emailed Deutsch and Michael Greenblatt, Celsius\u2019s corporate counsel, to ask what was going on. \u201cMichael and Ron how are you? Tough times I know!!\u201d Then he expressed his fears for the first time. \u201cI would like to ask for some investor reporting to be sent our way. Especially in times like this it\u2019s critical to share some insights so we don\u2019t get hung up on social media news which has been overwhelmingly negative to Celsius, unfortunately.\u201d He had meetings with partner investors the following week, he said, \u201cand I will be expected to be able to comment at a high level in our portfolio companies and I\u2019m afraid I have no real insights on key matters such Celsius wrt [with relation to] market impact to $ inflows and AUM [assets under management], expected rev [revenue] and user and AUM growth for the year, timing of the IPO of the mining business in this current market, the CEL token collapse and the UST [stablecoin] story.\u201d \u201cIt would be useful for me to also know what elements are for my ears only,\u201d he wrote. He then noted, also for the first time, that he doubted he could meet a deadline for investing the next $2 million of his $8 million commitment, which was due at the end of the week. \u201cI would like to ask if we can delay this to accommodate a slight delay in our paper work,\u201d he said. He got his meeting with the executives at Celsius but remained worried. \u2018Damn the Torpedoes\u2019 The next day, Celsius posted a long essay on Medium, titled, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead,\u201d in which the company argued that \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that vocal actors are spreading misinformation and confusion.\u201d \u201cThey have tried unsuccessfully, for example, to link Celsius to the collapse of Luna and falsely claim that Celsius sustained significant losses as a result,\u201d the company wrote. It also addressed the fact that some customers\u2019 accounts had been frozen \u2014 or placed in \u201cHODL mode\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for them to withdraw their funds. \u201cThey have stirred confusion around HODL mode and the importance of protecting user accounts,\u201d the essay said. Internally, Celsius executives believed they had escaped damage from the Luna fiasco. But customers were nonetheless withdrawing funds from the platform. Celsius\u2019s native token, CEL, had become nearly worthless, creating a potential run on the bank. But denying the rumours in such detail only gave them further life. Customers were freaked out that their accounts were locked as crypto prices crash all through the spring and summer. \u2018Liquidity crisis\u2019 Four days later, on June 10, Hansjee emailed Deutsch and Greenblatt again, requesting an update. This time, Hansjee used the phrase \u201cliquidity crisis\u201d \u2014 suggesting he believed Celsius might not survive. \u201cWhat are the current short term assets (cash and cash equivalents) vs equivalent liabilities? what are current withdrawals and what sort of withdrawal level will lead to a liquidity crisis?\u201d he wrote. On June 13, Celsius froze all customer accounts in an attempt to halt withdrawals so that the platform could be stabilised. Over the next few weeks, it became clear to Hansjee and his colleagues at Fabric that Celsius was not going to make it. The immediate problem for Fabric was that the firm had signed paperwork committing them to invest a further $6 million, imminently. Fabric decided not to throw good money after bad. \u2018Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC\u2019 On July 8, Julien Th\u00e9venard, an associate at Fabric, sent a formal letter to Greenblatt. They were pulling the investment. And they wanted their money back: \u201cRegrettably we are not in a position to proceed with our previous offer of investment. Please can you therefore return the initial advance of 2m USDC sent on 10th May 2022, which was sent pending closure of our fundraising and allotment of equity.\u201d The meaning of \u2018irrevocably\u2019 At the time, Hansjee probably thought he was doing the right thing. He may have lost $2 million, but at least he had saved the remaining $6 million. How could he possibly be expected to \u201cinvest\u201d in a company that was imminently and publicly going out of business? (He and other Fabric executives involved did not return requests for comment.) Celsius\u2019s debtors-in-possession see it differently, of course. The investment contract between Celsius and Fabric was clear: it committed Fabric to the investment \u201cirrevocably\u201d. Fabric \u201chereby irrevocably applies to subscribe for 391 Preferred B Shares of \u00a30.00001 each in the capital of the Company for cash at a price of $20,469 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions of the articles of association of the Company.\u201d Lawyers for Celsius did not return multiple requests for comment. It is the Celsius debtors\u2019 job to recover as much money as possible in order to pay back as many people as possible. To them, the Fabric contract is simple: You promised to pay us $8 million, and you still owe us $6 million. Where, exactly, is Fabric\u2019s investment? The court will now be asked to decide whether Fabric\u2019s contractual promise to pay is binding, despite the fact that Celsius was collapsing even as it was due. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Before the bankruptcy, Fabric also accused Celsius of mishandling its investment, which had been transmitted in the form of the USDC stablecoin. Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email said Celsius had agreed to keep Fabric\u2019s first $2 million in a \u201csegregated\u201d investment account. But blockchain data showed that the money had immediately been moved to a different wallet. \u201cThe chain data shows that within 24 hrs of confirming receipt of our funds, these were then moved onto \u2018Celsius Network: Wallet 5\u2032,\u201d he wrote. Worse, it was no longer clear where Fabric\u2019s $2 million in stablecoins was now. The USDC had been transferred into \u201can on-chain wallet controlled by Celsius with high volumes of transaction (several hundred thousand transactions), presumably a \u201chot wallet\u201d of Celsius and not a segregated investment account. We note that the USDC balance on this Wallet (\u201dCelsius Network: Wallet 5) is now only 31,367.734793; so the funds have been moved again. We deem this to be a serious breach of the commitment.\u201d The court will therefore have to decide whether Celsius broke the terms of Fabric\u2019s agreement, if it turns out the money was not segregated. Five days after Th\u00e9venard\u2019s email, on July 13, 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy. Fabric has yet to respond to the complaint."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Do Kwon is staging a comeback after Terra\u2019s $60 billion collapse. The disgraced CEO of Terraform Labs, whose stablecoin, Terra, collapsed last year, is working on several new products and bulking out his engineering department with new hires. The CEO, wanted by his native South Korea while Interpol seeks his arrest, remains \u201cactively involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm,\u201d Zion Schum, Terraform Labs\u2019 head of communications, confirmed to DL News. This involves \u201call aspects of the strategy and direction of Terraform Labs across all products in development,\u201d said Schum. The rebound attempt from such a persona non grata in crypto is bold \u2013 even in an industry rife with second chances. Terra\u2019s implosion contributed to the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, as well as crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. Terra relaunched its project shortly after the collapse of UST. The new blockchain used the same name but ditched the failed stablecoin \u2013 and prompted suspicions that Kwon could lead the market to yet another failure. While Kwon\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, South Korean prosecutors have said that Kwon has fled to Serbia. Schum declined to provide Kwon\u2019s location and Kwon could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s an opportunity to work with \u2018the most talented guy in DeFi\u2019 To get the new chain going, the company is hiring for over a dozen roles, including a full-stack engineer and a smart contract developer. Terraform Labs has posted several of these job vacancies after Terra collapsed last May. At least one developer has joined the company since, according to LinkedIn; the TFL spokesperson said that the company now has about 40-50 employees. Earlier this month, Kwon personally discussed potential roles with an interested candidate, who told DL News that it was an opportunity to work with \u201cthe most talented guy in DeFi.\u201d The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on Kwon\u2019s involvement with hiring. Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision Despite the charges against Kwon, Terraform Labs\u2019 grand vision rebuilds Terra as a multi-chain \u201clayer 1\u2033 protocol. The company is working on several projects in an attempt to grow the network. In January, Terraform Labs launched an interchain wallet called Station, which has so far secured the support of about two dozen Cosmos-based blockchains. TFL\u2019s new wallet looks a lot like the wallet it produced for the old Terra network and adds support for other Cosmos chains. The TFL spokesperson said it plans to expand Station to Ethereum Virtual Machine chains in the near future. In November, Terraform Labs said it was working on an economic module called Alliance. It allows holders of tokens from chains that have signed up to the Alliance to stake their tokens on another chain. This earns holders extra yields and secures both networks. Participating protocols can choose, via a governance vote, which tokens to accept from other chains in the Alliance. Eligible tokens include native tokens and complex derivatives. Tools from other networks, like Osmosis\u2019s Superfluid Staking, perform somewhat similar services. Yet unlike Superfluid Staking, Alliance does not require stakers to become liquidity providers, sparing them from what\u2019s called impermanent loss. TFL\u2019s purported innovation is that Alliance automates this process, and provides an economic incentive to split yields across blockchains. The ability to trade yields should \u201cattract users, liquidity, and talent from other ecosystems,\u201d said Schum. The company plans to start rolling out Alliance next month. So far, five projects have said they will implement Alliance at launch. Kwon\u2019s third protocol, Feather, makes it easy to spin up new blockchains. These blockchains are backed by validators on the Terra blockchain that opt into Feather, and come with tools like a blockchain explorer and interchain wallet. After this month\u2019s spate of announcements, the price of Terra\u2019s coin, LUNA, shot up from $1.29 to highs of $2.50, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The coin is currently worth about $2.05. Part of the hike could be explained by the rising price of Bitcoin, which rose from $16,669 to $23,282 in the same period. But few people are using Terra, even after the announcements. A dashboard on Flipside Crypto counts just 12,868 users. And after Terra collapsed because of its poor design, of concern is whether TFL\u2019s new tools are any good. Hyungsuk Kang, who worked as a software engineer for Terraform Labs in the second half of 2020 before setting up his own stablecoin protocol, told DL News that TFL employees at the time were inexperienced in blockchain development. Kang said many TFL employees internally discussed the likely failure of their project. That was under Kwon\u2019s leadership, sparking concerns about his return to the TFL, Kang said. Schum declined to comment on the level of experience of TFL employees in the early days of the company. \u2018I don\u2019t think he can repair his image\u2019 Terra may have been Kwon\u2019s second attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin. Kang and other former TFL employees allege that Kwon was behind Basis Cash, a resurrection of a failed algorithmic stablecoin called Basis that had raised $133 million before closing in 2018. The TFL spokesperson declined to comment on these allegations. Alongside running TFL, Kwon must navigate his legal troubles. Serbia does not have an extradition treaty with Kwon\u2019s native Korea but both have previously agreed to requests under the European Convention on Extradition. If Kwon were extradited, legal experts say he could file a legal complaint against Serbia, potentially giving him several years before he has to return. At least two Terraform Labs employees live in Serbia. Neither responded to requests for comment from DL News. That could give Kwon enough time for another bull run \u2013 and another chance to attract novice investors who are unaware of the industry\u2019s prior failures. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can repair his image,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, Korean co-founder of blockchain node validation company Stable Node, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s not that [Koreans are] forgiving. It\u2019s more that they are forgetful.\u201d"

But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely.

Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022. The lawsuit claimed that the Chicago trading giant joined hands with Terraform Lab\u2019s then-CEO Do Kwon to drive up the price of UST.\n\nIt also noted that Jump Trading was an early partner and financial supporter of Terraform Labs.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission attempts to position itself as the country\u2019s top crypto regulators, but it seems lawmakers want to cut the agency out of a new stablecoin bill. Instead of the SEC, US Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the Federal Reserve should regulate the new bill, if it ever gets passed into law, according to insiders on Capitol Hill.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company.

Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "Squid secures $4m to fuel competition in one-click transfers between blockchains",
                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings. Goran Rodic, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer, told DL News earlier this month that his client had accepted he would be extradited. They appealed who gets to decide which nation he would go to \u2014 the Minister of Justice or a court.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

The BLDF \u2014 co-founded by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey \u2014 argues Wright and his company Tulip Trading undermine \u201cfundamental principles of freedom\u201d with the lawsuit. Wright claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator, and has filed a series of lawsuits across the globe involving his rights to Bitcoin.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission attempts to position itself as the country\u2019s top crypto regulators, but it seems lawmakers want to cut the agency out of a new stablecoin bill. Instead of the SEC, US Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the Federal Reserve should regulate the new bill, if it ever gets passed into law, according to insiders on Capitol Hill. The new bill was introduced earlier in April and is an updated version of a bill from 2022, which had bipartisan support.

Chris Giancarlo made the comments in speech on Wednesday. He referenced his CFTC work in 2017, when the agency approved futures contracts involving Bitcoin, and added that those contracts remain the only fully regulated such product to date. Their success, he added, is \u201cproof that regulators can engage successfully with crypto if they have the will to do so.\u201d Dubbed \u201cCrypto Dad\u201d by digital asset advocates, Giancarlo also criticised regulators for not including language related to privacy in recent discussions on stablecoins.

Official records obtained from the Serbian Business Registry show Kwon opened a company called \u201cCodokoj22 d.o.o. Beograd\u201d on October 12. The address listed is in the old town of the Serbian capital\u2019s city centre. It is not possible to search the Serbian Business Registry by the names of the individuals. Registry officials confirmed to DL News on Friday that two South Koreans named Do Kwon and Han Chang-Joon were listed with a company number. Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Fraud charges The sole owner of the new company is Do Hyuang Kwon \u2013 he is named as a director alongside Han Chang-Joon from Chai Corporation. Interpol issued a Red Notice for Kwon on Sept. 20. The two men were arrested last Thursday at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro on a private jet bound for Dubai. Both are wanted by South Korean prosecutors for fraud charges in connection with the collapse last May of Terra, the blockchain \u201cecosystem\u201d, Kwon co-founded. Kwon is also facing eight counts of fraud-related charges in the US. Authorities in Singapore where Terra is based, are also probing the company. Terra\u2019s tokens LUNA and UST cratered last year and wiped out $60 billion in market value. NOW READ: Do Kwon was nabbed in a private jet on tarmac in Montenegro with false Costa Rican passport A Montenegrin judge ruled on Friday that Do Kwon and Han will be detained for 30 days while they are investigated for attempting to leave the country with allegedly forged Costa Rican passports. Han Chang-joon requested to give his statement in his native Korean, delaying the proceedings until a translator could be found. The nearest South Korean embassy is 200 miles away in Sofia, Bulgaria\u2019s capital. Serbian company Do Kwon Registration (Serbian Business Registry) Their Serbian company was registered with the main activity of \u201cconsultancy services,\u201d which is widely used for a \u201cgeneral coverage\u201d of the business. The company was established with 100 Serbian dinars in capital, which is less than a euro. Do Kwon and Han Chang Joon used their Korean passports while registering a company with the Serbian Business Registry. The company is still active. NOW READ: Stablecoins and Binance next in SEC crosshairs after Coinbase warning DL News contacted the Serbian Business Registry to ask if its officials are aware Do Kwon was a person wanted by Interpol. The Serbian Business Registry said it didn\u2019t have any information about the Interpol Red Notice. The lawyers who helped him The official document from the registry reveals that Do Kwon contracted a Serbian law firm called Gecic Law to represent him. Serbian lawyer Ognjen Colic, a partner at Gecic Law Firm based in Belgrade, submitted the request for registration on behalf of Kwon and Han. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. Colic declined to comment on the case, and said he didn\u2019t know his client had been arrested and charged with document forgery in neighbouring Montenegro. \u201cI cannot comment on my client due to confidentiality agreements, but I can say that this client went through all our regular security checks that our conducts for every client, including the Interpol website and he is not on there \u2013 you can check it yourself now,\u201d Colic said. Do Kwon in hiding Another lawyer from the same company, Milos Petakovic, signed the company statute on behalf of Do Kwon, the official document from Serbian Business Registry reveals.

                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Happy Sunday! Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations. JPEX said it had \u201cstrived to comply\u201d with the rules that took effect in June, but its efforts were \u201cdismissed or sidestepped with official rhetoric,\u201d according to the report. Coinbase was approved by the Bank of Spain as a Bitcoin and digital assets exchange and custodial wallet service provider, Crypto.News reported. Nana Murugesan, Coinbase\u2019s vice president of international and business development, said the approval will allow the company to expand its services for retail consumers, institutional clients, and developer partners in the region, according to the report.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The @Karak_Network aka Subsea @riskharborchina funded again by @PanteraCapital\n6.6M USD in UST of community funds on the Terra chain were withdrawn using a risk harbor team wallet without consent of governance and after bots spammed the address usedhttps://t.co/Dc25u1DHaA pic.twitter.com/ntmkSC63ia \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next.

I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol.

CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

                "headline": "Karak says its $7m post-Terra funds aren\u2019t a \u2018scam or rug-pull.\u2019 Others aren\u2019t so sure",
                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice.

The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022.

                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits.

                "headline": "Karak says its $7m post-Terra funds aren\u2019t a \u2018scam or rug-pull.\u2019 Others aren\u2019t so sure",
                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations. JPEX said it had \u201cstrived to comply\u201d with the rules that took effect in June, but its efforts were \u201cdismissed or sidestepped with official rhetoric,\u201d according to the report. Coinbase was approved by the Bank of Spain as a Bitcoin and digital assets exchange and custodial wallet service provider, Crypto.News reported.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits.

One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported. NOW READ: Bitcoin fee surge spurs calls for changes to treat NFTs and meme coins as spam Ethereum liquid staking protocol Lido upgraded to its version two on Monday, which allows users to unstake their Ether from the protocol for the first time. The upgrade saw Lido\u2019s price jump 10%, as users could now verify the platform would function as promised. Lido currently holds 80% of all Ethereum liquid staking derivative market share. The US Secret Service touted the transparency of blockchain technology in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session hosted by Reddit on Monday, and highlighted the agency\u2019s NFT collection. The Secret Service and California cybercrime authorities gave insight into a variety of scam methods, and praised blockchain for providing \u201can amazing opportunity to track the flow of money.\u201d When asked if the agency would consider releasing a token or coin, Secret Service agents pointed to an NFT collection released by the San Francisco field office last year.

                "headline": "Karak says its $7m post-Terra funds aren\u2019t a \u2018scam or rug-pull.\u2019 Others aren\u2019t so sure",
                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "US regulators want fiscal penalties greater than those levied on Binance.\nA civil jury found the Terra founder defrauded investors in $60bn collapse of DeFi project.\nHis extradition to South Korea is imminent.",
                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings. Goran Rodic, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer, told DL News earlier this month that his client had accepted he would be extradited. They appealed who gets to decide which nation he would go to \u2014 the Minister of Justice or a court.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

                "keypoints": "Chains: This subsection shows data for individual blockchains. It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph. The dashboard describes the services offered in each category and how many protocols are included in them.\nRecent: Arriving early to a project can sometimes be a financial boon. The Recent subsection includes a list of protocols recently-added to DefiLlama, their market category and their TVL.\nLanguages: One for the coders and developers, this subsection shows which coding languages protocols are written in. So far, there are 17 languages including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.",
                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports.

                "headline": "Karak says its $7m post-Terra funds aren\u2019t a \u2018scam or rug-pull.\u2019 Others aren\u2019t so sure",
                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " The US isn\u2019t forgetting about Do Kwon. The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Singapore investors seek funds lost in the Terra collapse.\nJudge signals potential sanctions for legal manoeuvring.\nA decision on the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro is still pending.",
                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days.

What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022.

Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported.

                "keypoints": "The Terra Classic community has accused Karak of appropriating $7 million.\nKarak says it took the funds, and doesn't recognise the Terra Classic community.\nCode changes, a deleted governance proposal, and spam transactions during the time the funds were taken raise questions.",
                "body": " DeFi protocol Karak, the latest entrant to crypto\u2019s buzzy restaking sector, is already facing controversy less than a month after launch. Dozens of DeFi users and members of the Terra Classic community accused Andalusia Labs, the firm behind Karak, of swiping 200 million USTC tokens \u2014 worth some $7 million at the time \u2014 from the Terra ecosystem a few months after its collapse in 2022. Karak earlier this month hit back at accusations, saying on X: \u201cno user funds were involved or ever misappropriated. Any claims otherwise [are] FUD,\u201d or fear, uncertainty, and doubt. \u201cThat 200 million USTC was never the property of Risk Harbor,\u201d Alex, a leader in the Terra Classic community during 2022 and 2023, told DL News. \u201cThey were partial custodians of that money on the Terra Classic community\u2019s behalf,\u201d he claimed. Alex declined to use his last name for privacy reasons. But Andalusia Labs claims the tokens belong to it \u2014 co-founder Raouf Ben-Har said in Karak\u2019s public Discord channel earlier this month that it was \u201cgranted\u201d the 200 million USTC tokens. They are thus theirs to spend as the organisation sees fit. Members of the Karak team and Andalusia Labs didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The episode shows how the May 2022 fall of Terra is still reverberating in DeFi almost two years later. The allegations also mar Andalusia Labs\u2019 coming-out party for Karak. Karak is the first to challenge EigenLayer\u2019s dominance of the market, and it\u2019s already taken in over $350 million of user deposits. And Andalusia Labs just scored a $1 billion valuation amid capital from big-name backers including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. Onchain data shows that the 200 million USTC trace back to the Terra blockchain community pool. On April 10, 2022, the Terra community sent 200 million UST from the community pool to a project called Ozone. Ozone was a decentralised insurance protocol that Risk Harbor managed on behalf of Terra creator Terraform Labs. The 200 million tokens was an initial tranche of $1 billion in TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar, that the Terra community allocated from its community pool specifically for the purpose of backing assets on Terra in the event of a collapse, according to the original 2022 proposal. The proposal stipulated that the $1 billion would be used for that purpose at Ozone \u201cindefinitely, unless a counter-proposal is passed to remove the said underwriting funds.\u201d The document never mentions a grant, or that the funds could be used for any other purpose. But Ben-Har said in the Discord post earlier this month that Andalusia Labs instead plans to use the proceeds of the 200 million USTC to insure Karak\u2019s restaking pools. That rankled the Terra community. Ben-Har hit back: \u201cEquating [it] to a scam or rug pull, is categorically FUD, slander, and disparaging,\u201d he said in the post. Neither Ben-Har nor Karak responded to requests for further comment on the discrepancy. Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel in 2022 shed light on how he viewed the situation: \u201cThese community funds will be used to underwrite protection, not to pay development, audits, or any other activities,\u201d Patel said on the Terra governance forums in response to the original proposal. Back in March 2022, after the Terra community voted to allocate $1 billion in stablecoins to Ozone, Risk Harbor created and deployed a new smart contract to facilitate the underwriting. The new smart contract was coded to allow two wallets to remove funds. One was a wallet controlled by six people chosen to govern the Ozone treasury. It was a so-called multi-signature wallet, meaning that it needs multiple parties to sign off on transactions. The other was Risk Harbor\u2019s own wallet. The $40 billion collapse of Terra only a few months later upended the whole project, before the remaining $800 million in Terra stablecoins destined for Ozone could be allocated. After the collapse, the Terra Classic community took over stewardship of the blockchain from Terraform Labs, the company that built the Terra blockchain. The Terra stablecoin was rebranded to TerraUSD Classic, now known as USTC. Terraform Labs filed for bankruptcy, but tokens on the Terra blockchain held some value \u2014 the 200 million in Terra stablecoins given to Ozone had a market value of around $7 million at the time. By July 2022, a strange thing happened. Onchain records show that the Risk Harbor admin wallet received the 200 million USTC from the Ozone underwriting contract using the contract\u2019s \u201callow list\u201d exception. Over the next few weeks, onchain records also show that the Risk Harbor wallet sent the 200 million USTC to unknown accounts on exchanges Binance and Kucoin in five separate transactions. It\u2019s unclear who those accounts belonged to, but the money did not end up where it was originally intended before Terra\u2019s collapse: Ozone. During this period, the Ozone underwriting contract started to receive thousands of spam transactions. \u201cSomeone set up an automated task to send that contract the minimum amount of funds,\u201d said Ray Raspberry, a pseudonymous crypto sleuth who has investigated and documented the situation with Risk Harbor. Onchain records confirm Ray\u2019s discovery. The transactions are anonymous, and there is nothing to suggest they are linked to Risk Harbor. Yet Fragwuerdig, a former member of Terra Classic developer L1TF, wondered to DL News if the spam was an attempt to obscure the transactions to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Ben-Har and Andalusia Labs did not reply to requests for comment on those spam transactions. Before Risk Harbor deployed the UST underwriting contract, it hired an outside firm to audit it. In an April 16 X post, the firm said that the version it was sent to audit didn\u2019t contain any \u201callow list\u201d of wallets. DL News asked Andalusia Labs why the version it sent to the auditor was different to the one it eventually deployed and did not contain the \u201callow list\u201d exceptions, but didn\u2019t receive a response. Records show that at some point between May 2022 and February 2023, the original proposal to allocate Terra community pool funds to Ozone was edited. The author, a pseudonymous community contributor at Risk Harbor called Tooney, removed all details of the proposal. Tooney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on why the proposal was deleted. In July 2023, the Terra Classic community voted to return the funds intended for insuring UST through Ozone. The community successfully retrieved 800 million USTC that was controlled by a Terra community multi-signature wallet, but was unable to recover the 200 million that went to Risk Harbor\u2019s wallet. Karak said it sold the funds, according to an April 12 X post. It again said tokens were \u201cgranted\u201d from the Terra Foundation, and that it didn\u2019t recognise the governance proposal asking for their return. \u201cRisk Harbor only dealt with the old Terra governance before it was destroyed\u201d by Terra\u2019s 2022 collapse, Karak said. The $1 billion \u201cgranted\u201d to Ozone \u201cwas already minted and earmarked by the old Terra foundation for Ozone as collateral for risk pools,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that throughout the life of Risk Harbor, all users who purchased protection were always paid out when conditions were met.\u201d Karak continued: \u201cSeveral months after the collapse when it was clear that the network was abandoned, the Risk Harbor foundation sold $6 million worth of UST out of the initial grant to prevent further losses. No user funds were involved or ever misappropriated.\u201d \u201cThese funds have never been utilised by the team,\u201d Karak said. \u201cThey are held in custody by the Risk Harbor foundation and earmarked for a protection fund on initial restaking pools.\u201d But many in the Terra Classic community don\u2019t accept this explanation, and maintain that the funds have always belonged to them. \u201cI am very sad about the situation,\u201d Fragwuerdig said. \u201cThey are basically saying the chain or the entity does not exist, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t returned the funds.\u201d Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

The co-founder and onetime CEO of Terra may be on the verge of boarding a flight from Montenegro to his native South Korea to face fraud charges but Washington wants payback, too. More specifically, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $5.3 billion in penalties from Kwon and Terraform Labs, the amalgamation of entities that collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion in market value. On April 5, a US civil jury found Kwon defrauded Terra investors by misrepresenting the uses of its stablecoin, UST, and other offerings. Now the SEC us seeking a penalty that would exceed the $4.3 billion Binance paid in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US banking laws in connection with its failed anti-money laundering practices. In court papers filed on April 19, the SEC laid out details of how much Kwon should pay as part of a fraud lawsuit the agency brought against him and Terraform last year. While investors \u201clost everything,\u201d Terraform Labs and Kwon made more than $4 billion from their \u201cillegal conduct,\u201d the SEC said in the filing. The SEC is also calling for Kwon to be barred from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company. This is typical in cases involving allegations of investment fraud. Kwon has denied the allegations. He could not be reached for comment on this article. The SEC\u2019s move reminds us that despite the criminal allegations lodged against Kwon by South Korean prosecutors and a US grand jury, the one-time DeFi billionaire is still facing civil complaints. After hiding from South Korean authorities and Interpol for much of 2022, Kwon was arrested by Montenegro officials on March 23, 2023, while attempting to fly from Podgorica Airport to Dubai on a private jet. He and an associate travelling with him, Han Chang-joon, were convicted of using false Costa Rican passports to try and leave the small Balkan nation. In February, Han was extradited to South Korea. After months of hearings, Kwon was also ordered to return to South Korea rather than the US, where he has also been charged with fraud. In the latest filing, the SEC is asking a court to order Kwon and Terraform labs to pay $4.2 billion from the profits generated from Terra\u2019s stablecoin project. The commission also wants more than $546 million in prejudgment interest and another combined $520 million. Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent. Contact him at liam@dlnews.com.

With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance.

Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Squid Router has secured additional funding to expand its service.\nThe router offers one-click bridging for DeFi users.\nOne-click bridging is seen as an answer to the usual clunky user experience.",
                "body": " DeFi\u2019s $57 billion market is spread across blockchains requiring bridges, routers, and other forms of middleware for cryptocurrency and NFT flow throughout these unconnected networks. Bridges enable users to send crypto across blockchains while routers aggregate bridges and decentralised exchanges into a single application to make the process much easier. Cryptocurrency worth about $6.7 billion has moved across blockchains thanks to these bridges and routers in the past month, DefiLlama data shows. Squid, one of those crypto routers that launched last year, has raised an additional funding of $4 million from investors led by Polychain Capital to command a larger share of the market. \u201cWe anticipate expanding to Bitcoin soon and other major ecosystems throughout the year, and we\u2019ll be integrating additional interoperability service providers in order to accomplish that,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. Interacting with different blockchains \u2014 what the industry calls interoperability \u2014 requires these middleware protocols, but they can also be clunky for users. The process often involves long wait times and multiple clicks to approve transactions. Sometimes, funds can get stuck during the chain-hopping process, a problem that can be difficult to solve. Squid\u2019s trying to make things a little easier with just one-click transfers that take less than 20 seconds. \u201cThe one-click user experience is essential,\u201d Christina R\u00fcd, Squid Router co-founder, told DL News. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Web2 apps make users click multiple times to accomplish a single action, and they\u2019re definitely not making users wait minutes or hours for things to happen.\u201d But Squid Router is competing in a fierce market not alone in offering this single-click feature. Bridges like Celer Network and decentralised exchanges like Rubic and Universal Swap also have similar one-click cross-chain transaction capabilities.Celer is perhaps the most well-known of the lot with the protocol processing over $165 million in cross-chain transactions in the last month. For DeFi middleware, speed is paramount. People seek to quickly move around assets, capturing arbitrage opportunities as they arise, making the option of one-click transactions highly attractive. While quick transfers are key for moving digital money between different networks, keeping those transfers safe is just as important. After all, DeFi middleware protocols remain a top target for hackers. In 2022, hackers stole over $2 billion in several cross-chain bridge attacks. Heco Bridge, another victim of these hacks, lost $86 million in 2023, as well as Multichain which saw $125 million disappear from its cross-chain bridge. Bridge hackers even signed off last year by stealing $81 million from the Orbit Bridge. When asked whether one-click poses a security trade-off for users, R\u00fcd only highlighted that Squid is built on top of Axelar, a cross-chain bridge protocol for DeFi. Unlike many bridges and routers, Axelar held up well during the UST collapse in 2022, and so it has been widely associated with stability. But LlamaRisk, a crypto risk assessment group, said in an April 2023 report that although \u201ctechnical security risk appears to be well-managed,\u201d the protocol currently operates on an upgradable smart contract controlled by eight signers. Since its launch, Squid says it has facilitated over $890 million in crypto bridge volume across more than 60 blockchains. The protocol ranks 14th on DefiLlama\u2019s log of crypto bridges based on 24-hour transaction volume. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

                "body": " Do Kwon\u2019s extradition is going back to square one. In a decision that will slow down a potential extradition of indicted crypto entrepreneur from Montenegro, an appellate court last week annulled the decision of a lower court and ordered the process to begin again, according to a statement published Tuesday on the court\u2019s website. The surprise ruling did not challenge the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision in November to extradite Kwon to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in both nations have charged Kwon with fraud in connection with the $60 billion collapse of the Terra blockchain network in May 2022. Rather, the Court of Appeal of Montenegro said technical problems arose that necessitated a redo. In a statement, it said the lower court judge heard Kwon in relation to South Korea\u2019s request but did not hear from him on the US request. \u201cThe decision was affected by a significant violation of the provisions of the criminal procedure,\u201d said the statement. The decision muddles an already complicated legal process around the fate of Kwon and an associate, Han Chang-Joon, both of whom are being detained in prison. The two men were on the run for months from Interpol only to get arrested in March on the tarmac of Podgorica Airport in Montenegro attempting to fly to Dubai with false Costa Rican passports. The Higher Court in Podgorica approved the extradition of Do Kwon in November following requests from the US and South Korea. It appeared to be up to the Minister of Justice to decide to which nation he would be sent to. This month, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer submitted an appeal, which postponed the next steps in extradition proceedings.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A judge in Singapore has had just about enough with Terraform Labs\u2019 lawyers. Last week, Hri Kumar Nair, a jurist in the city-state\u2019s high court, rejected an appeal by attorneys for Terraform Labs, the DeFi venture once led by Do Kwon, the onetime crypto fugitive. They were seeking to block a class action lawsuit filed by 377 investors who say they lost $57 million when the Terra group of ventures collapsed in May 2022 and wiped out $60 billion worth of market capitalisation. But the judge said the many delays by Terraform\u2019s legal team were \u201ctroubling\u201d and at odds with new legislation introduced in April 2022 aimed at expediting legal proceedings. He singled out Terraform for engaging in \u201cprocedural and strategic manoeuvres\u201d that were unnecessary for resolving a legal issue. Meanwhile, halfway around the world Kwon is seeking to delay another case stemming from the fall of Terraform\u2019s group of ventures \u2014 his looming extradition to the US or South Korea to face criminal charges of fraud. On Dec. 6, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyers in Montenegro, where he has been detained since March, appealed a court ruling clearing the way for his extradition. The move marks a shift because Kwon had earlier agreed to be extradited. Kwon and an associate were captured in March on the tarmac at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro using fake Costa Rican passports. The 31-year-old crypto entrepreneur had been on the run for months and was the target of an Interpol Red Notice. While it isn\u2019t clear whether Kwon will be sent to the US or South Korea, it seems only a matter of time before he is put on a plane to face charges that could result in his conviction and a lengthy prison term. Goran Rodi\u0107, Do Kwon\u2019s lawyer in Montenegro, told DL News he expects the court to decide on the appeal this month. Even as Kwon awaits his fate in a prison in the Balkan nation, investors are still picking up the pieces of his fallen empire in his onetime home base of Singapore. \u2018They had a white paper and... I thought this thing should be good.\u2019 During Kwon\u2019s stint in the city, he built Terra into a leading DeFi ecosystem complete with a blockchain network, a stablecoin, various tokens, and a lending arm. He lived in one of the city\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. He also amassed a crypto fortune believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cSteven,\u201d one of the plaintiffs in the class action, said he\u2019s keen to recover his own losses from Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Steven said he converted more than $1 million worth of UST, Terra\u2019s stablecoin, during the last bull run. He believed Terra\u2019s assertions that UST had ample reserves of Bitcoin to support the coin. When UST slipped its peg to the dollar in 2021, he also believed Terra \u201cself-healed\u201d thanks to its stability measures. \u201cI read press releases from Terra about UST saying it was backed by Bitcoin and they were growing the reserves,\u201d said Steven, who requested anonymity because he\u2019s involved in the class action litigation. \u201cThey had a white paper and when I saw that big exchanges were listing it and Do Kwon\u2019s tweets reassuring that UST is stable and truly decentralised, I thought, \u2018This thing should be good.\u2019\u201d Terra\u2019s lawyers are fighting Steven and his fellow investors with a number of procedural moves. They argued that the users had forfeited their rights to a jury trial or class-action participation due to an arbitration clause on Terra\u2019s website. Arbitration typically means disputes should be settled outside of court with an impartial referee. So far, their gambit hasn\u2019t worked, prompting a steady stream of appeals. In the recent hearing, Judge Hri Kumar Nair said any \u201cdeliberate or unreasonable\u201d conduct causing further delays would be met with stringent court sanctions. Steven said he and his fellow plaintiffs are following Kwon\u2019s extradition proceedings closely. He is optimistic that wherever Kwon gets sent, he will still have to answer for his actions, even if he is not physically in Singapore. \u201cHe was living a luxurious life in Singapore, even after the depeg\u2026 He was living in the building next to the head of police in Serbia,\u201d Steven said. Earlier this year, DL News reported that Do Kwon\u2019s associate Han Chang-Joon was the owner of a \u20ac2 million luxury apartment in the prestigious district of Belgrade. The pair also established a company in Serbia in October 2022, despite being wanted by Interpol in connection with the collapse of Terra. \u201cHe thought he would be untouchable,\u201d Steven said.

                "body": " Happy Monday! The trial against Terra co-founder Daniel Shin started in the Seoul Southern District Court today, according to South Korean news outlet Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation. The prosecution has accused him of fraud, breach of duty, embezzlement, and of violating the South Korean Capital Markets Act. He has denied all charges. Let\u2019s dive into it. Daniel Shin \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d Terra\u2019s collapse, the Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s legal counsel said on Shin\u2019s first day in court today, MBC reports. Terraform Labs was the company behind Terra, a blockchain that soared to a $60 billion market capitalisation before crashing in May 2022 when its native token and stablecoin, LUNA and UST, entered a death spiral. Shin\u2019s legal counsel told the court that Shin had broken off with fellow Terraform co-founder Do Kwon in 2020, and that Terra\u2019s collapse was due to the Anchor protocol\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d management as well as \u201cexternal attacks\u201d carried out by Kwon, MBC reports as per Google translate. Anchor was a Terra-based protocol that provided users a 20% yield on UST holdings. Kwon is currently held in a Montenegrin prison cell after attempting to leave the country by using a fake Costa Rican passport. South Korean and US authorities are both seeking his extradition. Shin\u2019s lawyer said Shin had voluntarily returned from Singapore to South Korea and actively cooperated with authorities in the Terra investigation.

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Fenwick & West, a law firm that previously provided legal services to bankrupt exchange FTX and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed for dismissal of a class-action lawsuit, while South Korean entertainment company Dreamus is offering NFT K-pop tickets, and Dubai-based crypto exchange JPEX is under investigation in Hong Kong. Read on! Fenwick & West, a law firm that formerly provided services to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, filed to dismiss a class-action lawsuit claiming that it assisted in the exchange\u2019s alleged frauds, Cointelegraph reported. The law firm denied all accusations of misconduct, contending that while it had provided FTX with regular, lawful legal services, former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried had misused its advice. Dreamus, a South Korean entertainment company, is offering NFT ticketing services through its parent SK Planet\u2019s rewards app, Cryptonews reported. Fans can buy tickets to events including K-pop concerts in the form of Avalanche NFTs on SK Planet\u2019s private Avalanche subnet, the report said. The Terra Classic community voted to stop minting and reminting TerraUSD Classic (USTC), as it looks to restore a stable peg to the US dollar, Cointelegraph reported. About 59% of the community voted to stop minting USTC, while 40% were opposed. USTC depegged from the US dollar in May 2022, causing Terra to collapse and eventually leading to billions in losses in the broader market. Crypto trading platform JPEX is being probed by Hong Kong police after about 2,000 investors complained of $166 million in losses, the BBC reported. Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission recently said Dubai-based JPEX had been operating without a licence for trading digital assets. The case may provide a test for Hong Kong\u2019s new financial regulations.

                "body": " It\u2019s worth getting to grips with trading volumes if you want to better understand the crypto market. A crypto-asset\u2019s trading volume \u2014 how much of it is bought and sold within a given time frame \u2014 spins a complex yarn about its popularity. These intervals can range from minutes, hours, months, or even years. Analysing trading volumes can reveal valuable insights into the inflows and outflows of money in DeFi, as well as the liquidity of specific assets. When trading volumes spike, you\u2019ll know something big is happening in the market \u2014 and it often isn\u2019t good news. For example, trading volumes for Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin soared to all-time highs during its collapse in May 2022. Then when USDC broke its dollar peg in March 2023 amid the crypto banking meltdown, Ethereum decentralised exchanges recorded their highest ever trading volumes. On the other hand, a slow and steady increase in trading volume can suggest increased use and adoption of a DeFi protocol or blockchain. But be careful \u2014 often trading volumes turn out to be completely fraudulent. In an early application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, software services provider Bitwise complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission that 95% of Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume on CoinMarketCap was entirely made up. Things aren\u2019t necessarily much better today. This article will explain what crypto trading volumes are, how they are calculated and how to follow along using DefiLlama. In the cryptocurrency market, trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of a particular asset within a specific amount of time. Trading volume data is a mix of self-reported volume from cryptocurrency exchanges, much of it unverifiable, and on-chain volumes from decentralised finance protocols that are verifiable and traceable. For example, the overall daily trading volume of Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is about $8.6 billion, according to crypto metrics site CoinMarketCap. This figure represents all the ETH that has been bought or sold on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past 24 hours. It includes self-reported data from centralised exchanges and data scraped from DeFi protocols, like Uniswap, and excludes peer-to-peer transfers and over-the-counter trading. In comparison, trading volume data on DefiLlama only draws from verifiable on-chain data, and looks at total trading volumes on specific blockchains or DeFi protocols, rather than for individual assets. High trading volumes can signal strong buying pressure, where investors are eager to purchase an asset, or strong selling pressure, where investors are offloading their holdings. Indeed, there\u2019s a whole art dedicated to tracking changes in prices and volumes called technical analysis, where traders attempt to predict a cryptocurrency\u2019s future price by deferring to patterns in price and volume charts. While sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko focus on volumes of the entire crypto market, DefiLlama offers a comprehensive view of DeFi trading volumes. The Overview subsection lists trading volumes for decentralised exchanges, in order of 24-hour trading volume. Users can filter the data on daily, weekly, or monthly time frames, and across dozens of different blockchains. The Chains subsection, on the other hand, provides data on the total trading volumes on different blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain. Users can find data showing the weekly change in trading volume and cumulative trading volume in addition to daily and weekly time frames. Dexs volume by chain A graph of monthly decentralised exchange volume dominance is presented in its entirety. Note the user has hovered over November 2, 2022, which presents data for exchange volume dominance across different blockchains on that day. (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez) For those interested in the non-fungible token market, DefiLlama also tracks trading volumes for popular NFT projects and marketplaces. It lists metrics, such as floor price, price change, volume, and collection supply, for various NFT collections. Additionally, DefiLlama ranks NFT marketplaces by volume, market share, and number of trades. The Derivatives and Options subsections provide data on the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures, across different platforms. Users can filter the data by platform, blockchain, and time frame, allowing them to track the performance of different derivatives products and trading activity over time. Even on-chain data isn\u2019t necessarily an accurate depiction of a protocol or asset\u2019s trading volume. Fraudulent exchanges or traders can artificially inflate trading volumes to bump up the numbers, making an asset or protocol look more popular than it actually is. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say in programming. Various accounting efforts have attempted to offset bogus trading volumes. NFT wash trading filters, like those offered on Nansen, CryptoSlam or on DefiLlama, try to remove inorganic activity and provide a more accurate picture of on-chain trading. To highlight the extent of wash trading, DefiLlama\u2019s NFT trading volume dashboard includes data showing the percentage of inorganic trades relative to organic trades over the past seven days. Happy hunting!"

It displays active user count, the number of protocols built on the chain, TVL, and the combined value of all stablecoins on the network.\nCompare Chains: This subsection lets users pit blockchains against each other by comparing TVL, fees and revenue, transaction count, and active user count.\nAirdrops: This dashboard lists DeFi protocols without tokens which may potentially launch one and distribute it through an airdrop to early adopters. The dashboard includes market category data, TVL, money raised, and notes how long ago it was listed on DefiLlama.\nTreasuries: Treasuries are protocol\u2019s warchests. This dashboard breaks down treasury assets by stablecoins, major assets like BTC and ETH, the protocol\u2019s native tokens, and other sundry coins.\nOracles: Oracles deliver price feeds to DeFi protocols. This subsection lists dozens of oracles and the combined total value locked of the projects they provide information for.\nForks: Successful projects tend to get copied in DeFi, and these copies are called forks. This dashboard lists the number of times the original project or chain has been copied and how much TVL the copies have compared to the original.\nTop Protocols: This table displays the top dogs of over 30 categories in DeFi, including liquid staking projects, lending markets, decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces.\nComparison: A place to compare multiple protocol\u2019s historical TVL.\nProtocol Expenses: This subsection includes a short list of protocols that have published information about their expenses. It also lists headcounts, which denote the number of active employees.\nToken Usage: This subsection explores the extent to which a DeFi project is exposed to ETH. A project greatly exposed to ETH in a bear market stands to gain the most if ETH rises in price.\nCategories: This section tracks the value of over 30 categories on a historical timeline graph.

                "body": " DefiLlama is a transparent and open-source analytics website for decentralised finance. What started as a simple TVL, or total value locked, tracker in 2020 has since evolved to track dozens of metrics for over 2,600 protocols across more than 180 blockchains. At no cost to its users, the site publishes metrics like trading volume, protocol revenues and fees and available yield rates, as well as detailed insights into protocol expenses, treasuries and hacks. This article will explain how to navigate all this information. DeFi Dashboard The DeFi Dashboard is DefiLlama\u2019s flagship dashboard. Located on the front page, it lists thousands of protocols and contains metrics such as TVL, volume, fees and revenue. In addition to the overview, there are 10 additional subsections to the Defi Dashboard: Yields The Yields dashboard is a DeFi farmer\u2019s godsend. It tracks around 9,000 pools across hundreds of protocols and dozens of chains. Researchers can use it to find the best money-making opportunities, then filter them by asset type, protocol, TVL, and historical annual percentage yield (APY). Some projects include a Reward APY \u2014 incentives paid out in a project\u2019s native token, rather than generated from trading fees, lending, or staking. Yield Rankings (DefiLlama) LlamaSwap DefiLlama created LlamaSwap, a free protocol which finds the best prices on crypto trades across the top 10 decentralised exchange aggregators. LlamaSwap (DefiLlama) NFTs Once a frenzied market, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have cooled off over the crypto winter. However, there\u2019s still data to mine, and DefiLlama tracks the most popular collections and markets. NFT Marketplaces (DefiLlama) Unlocks This section tracks when a venture capital firm or protocol team member\u2019s vested tokens are scheduled to be available for selling. These events tend to precede price movements. Sometimes, unlocked tokens are dumped onto the market pushing prices down. However, if holders decide not to sell their unlocked tokens, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and push the token\u2019s price higher. Token Unlocks (DefiLlama) Borrow Aggregator The Borrow Aggregator finds the best route for borrowing an asset with a specified collateral. The dashboard shows which protocols offer borrowing for a specified asset, the cost to borrow it, and the amount available to borrow. Borrow Aggregator (DefiLlama) CEX Transparency After several crypto companies failed in 2022, investors began demanding proof from these centralised giants that they did in fact hold enough assets in reserve to back customer deposits. Companies that have provided DefiLlama with on-chain data showing how much crypto they hold have it posted on the CEX Transparency dashboard. Using this data, DefiLlama also calculates the total value of an exchange\u2019s assets, the amount of money coming in and out of the exchange, and audit information, if any is available. CEX Transparency (DefiLlama) Bridges Bridges let DeFi users move assets between blockchains. The Bridges dashboard shows a historical timeline of the total volume of crypto moving across hundreds of bridges. Historical bridge transaction data is downloadable in .csv format. Bridge inflows by Chain (DefiLlama) Governance DeFi protocol stakeholders regularly put forward governance proposals, which, with enough support, are voted on by that protocol\u2019s token holders. These determine the future direction of a project. Tracking these proposals gives insight into what changes protocols are planning. The Governance dashboard tracks the history of proposals for hundreds of DeFi protocols. Governance (DefiLlama) Liquidations Liquidation is when a financial institution closes a business or trader\u2019s financial position to ensure it does accrue debt. In DeFi, the liquidation process is partially automated by smart contracts. DeFiLlama tracks liquidation data for 11 different lending protocols and dozens of assets across multiple chains. The Liquidations dashboard shows the total liquidatable amount of each asset and at what price specific token positions will enter liquidation. Liquidation levels in DeFi (DefiLlama) Volumes Trading volume refers to the value of all the trades of an asset within a specific time frame. The Volumes dashboard gives an overview of the trading volumes of tokens across numerous decentralised exchanges. The Chains subsection provides data on the trading volumes of assets across different blockchains, and the Options and Derivatives subsections show the trading volumes of various derivatives products, such as options and perpetual futures contracts, across different platforms. DEXs volume (DefiLlama) Fees /Revenue In decentralised finance, protocols charge fees, payable with crypto, for providing financial services. After paying operational costs including marketing, infrastructure, and salary, protocols use the crypto left over \u2014 the revenue \u2014 to improve the project, bolster treasuries, and provide rewards to incentivise people to use the platform. DeFiLlama\u2019s Fees/Revenue dashboard tracks the fees and revenue for hundreds of protocols across dozens of blockchains. This data, which spans 17 columns, also shows how much revenue goes to investors. Ranking by fees and revenue (DefiLlama) Raises The Raises dashboard displays a history of funding rounds for DeFi protocols and crypto startups, denoting the amount raised, which investors participated, and a description of what they invested in. All results can be filtered by sector, blockchain, investor, type of round and amount raised. An Active Investor subsection shows which funds are participating in what projects, and the number of deals they have been involved in over the past month. Raises (DefiLlama) Stables Stablecoins are arguably the lifeblood of DeFi. They are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as fiat currencies or gold. The landscape of the stablecoin market is just as important as that of the DeFi protocols using them. That\u2019s why DefiLlama dedicated a whole dashboard to stablecoin data. In it, you can find a total stablecoin market cap and historical timeline of stablecoin dominance. Over 100 stablecoins are listed and the dashboard shows what blockchains they are available on, their market cap, and what percentage off-peg they are \u2014 an off-peg stablecoin usually spells trouble; just ask Terra\u2019s UST. Stablecoin Market Caps (DefiLlama) Hacks The bane of the crypto industry, hacks and exploits have cost unwary investors billions over the years. Fortunately, there is a large community tracking every such event, and DefiLlama\u2019s Hacks dashboard records them all. This section includes a historical list of hacks and exploits dating back to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack. Each event is classified by what was affected, what technique the hacker used, and the total amount lost. Total Value Hacked (DefiLlama) ETH Liquid Staking The ETH liquid staking market has taken DeFi by storm ever since the Ethereum Network\u2019s Shapella upgrade in the second quarter of 2023. Liquid staking is where users stake their Ether through a DeFi protocol and receive a receipt-like token in return which represents their staked Ether. Holders can use this liquid staking token across other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity or as collateral for a loan. The ETH Liquid Staking dashboard shows the market share for different liquid staking protocols, what derivative is given by each protocol, and the annual percentage yield it pays. Total Value Locked ETH LSDs (DefiLlama) There you have it \u2014 DefiLlama\u2019s complete arsenal of investigative tools, all for free. With such an abundant collection of data, there\u2019s bound to be some helpful information for any who visit. Master these investigative tools and you are certain to become a well-informed DeFi(Llama) wizard."

                "keypoints": "New memecoin BALD whipsaws after apparent rugpull.\nCurve Finance severely damaged by exploit, founder sells off governance tokens.\nEthereum layer 2s continue raking in the cash.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. This weekend was a rollercoaster of emotions for DeFi degens. On Saturday evening, an unknown crypto whale launched a new memecoin called BALD on Base, the nascent Coinbase-backed layer 2 chain. The fact that the chain hasn\u2019t officially launched didn\u2019t stop traders from pouring millions into BALD, helping it rise to a market cap of almost $100 million at its peak. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Base had 24 hours of meme coin frenzy, rug pulls and $58m in deposits Some who chucked pocket change into the token on Saturday night, woke up the next day as millionaires. The situation echoed that of the PEPE memecoin, which speculators pumped to dizzying heights back in April. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 because Base is still in its early test phase, there\u2019s currently no real way to bridge large amounts off the chain back to Ethereum. There\u2019s also the question of who launched BALD in the first place. Blockchain sleuths were quick to point out that the same wallet had previously built up a highly-leveraged position of cbETH \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s Ether liquid staking token \u2014 on lending protocol Aave. The position is so precarious that Gauntlet, an organisation tasked with analysing the safety of Aave positions, highlighted the wallet as a risk to the protocol back in April. Then, on Monday afternoon, the BALD saga took a darker turn. The whale who deployed the memecoin and provided liquidity for it on decentralised exchange LeetSwap started pulling tokens off the exchange. The reduced liquidity caused BALD to flash crash over 90%. After the dust from the rug pull settled, the whale walked away with a net profit of 2,789 ETH, or $5.2 million dollars. The BALD deployer pulls the rug (CoinGecko) After the apparent rugpull, the crypto community immediately got to work trying to uncover who the BALD deployer is. Strangely, instead of using a fresh wallet, whoever launched BALD used one with a rich on-chain history, showing them interacting with Alameda Research wallets, voting on early Sushiswap governance proposals, and posting on the dYdX forums. All these clues (plus several more) have led many to accuse disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of launching BALD while he awaits trial for defrauding FTX customers. However, despite all the speculation, all evidence to suggest that Bankman-Fried is behind BALD is circumstantial at best \u2014 just chatter and guesswork. Bankman-Fried is currently under house arrest where he has limited access to the internet under the terms and conditions of bail aggreement, while he awaits trial. And if you\u2019re wondering why DeFi degens were so enamoured with a token called BALD, it\u2019s because of a running joke in DeFi circles started by long-time poster DegenSpartan. In recent months, they\u2019ve been very vocal about their investment in Coinbase stock. But if you ask them why they\u2019re so bullish the answer might not be quite what you expect. \u201cThe thesis for COIN is simple, Brian Armstrong, [Coinbase\u2019s founder and CEO], is bald,\u201d they recently tweeted. But mere hours after the initial BALD token euphoria, disaster struck at one of DeFi\u2019s most respected and long-standing protocols \u2014 Curve Finance. Many of the protocol\u2019s Ether trading pools were drained of a combined $61 million worth of tokens via a bug in outdated an version of code they used. The event crashed the price of Curve\u2019s CRV token, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed Aave loan at risk of liquidation \u2014 again. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis Egorov has since sold off almost 40 million CRV tokens to various parties and used the proceeds reduce his risk of liquidation, but the damage to Curve is severe. The protocol\u2019s total value locked has dropped over 46% as depositors withdrew $1.5 billion worth of tokens over fears that other Curve trading pools might also be at risk. Among those caught in the crossfire was JPEG\u2019d, a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans using NFTs as collateral. Its pETH-ETH Curve trading pool was one of the worst affected with an $11.4 million loss. The protocol\u2019s JPEG governance token dropped over 20% in the aftermath. While the fallout from this weekend\u2019s events is still reverberating across the DeFi space, let\u2019s not forget some of the big stories the DL News team explored last week. Last Monday, Callan Quinn investigated Uniswap Asia, an extravagant Ponzi scheme which operated in China using the top decentralised exchange\u2019s name. After going all out to dupe unwitting investors, Uniswap Asia pulled the plug on its operations on July 12 after it claimed it was \u201chacked.\u201d Check out Callan\u2019s story here to find out what happened next. Also last week, I published my first dispatch from EthCC. I talked to Eleftherios Diakomichalis about why crypto\u2019s open-source culture is so important and how his project Drips is helping open-source software developers get paid. Check out the full story here. Wrapping up last week\u2019s stories, Osato Avan-Nomayo wrote about the \u201crage quit\u201d of developers at Alameda-backed Parrot Protocol. The Parrot team have enraged the Solana DeFi community by proposing to pay themselves huge bonuses after failing to deliver on any of the project\u2019s roadmap. Find out how much the Parrot team stand to gain by reading the full story here. The rise and fall of Curve (@DefiLlama) The rise and fall of Curve Finance: After reaching an all-time high TVL of $24 billion, deposits to the decentralised exchange are now back to where they were in January 2021. The UST depeg, the FTX collapse, and this weekend\u2019s contract exploits have all taken their toll on the once-dominant protocol. PROPOSAL: Cosmos to add Fee Abstraction Module If approved, the Fee Abstraction Module will allow transaction fees on any Cosmos chain to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. VOTE: Should CoW DAO use protocol profits to generate extra revenue? CoW Swap\u2019s DAO is currently voting on if it should send protocol profits to its Treasury Core unit to be allocated across DeFi to generate revenue. If approved, the proposal suggests revenues could be reinvested into protocol development, funding projects, providing grants, or executing $COW token buybacks. PROPOSAL: MakerDAO to fast-track Enhanced Dai Savings Rate The proposal from MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen aims to increase use of the protocol\u2019s Dai stablecoin by bumping up the interest rate paid to sDAI holders. If approved, the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate would make Dai one of the safest, and highest yielding stable assets in DeFi. Last week, Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin officially launched, opening up locations across the globe where members of the public can scan their eyeballs in exchange for some WLD tokens. We\u2019re not sure if cats are eligible to sign up, or if they are allowed, what they would use their new, biometrically-guaranteed crypto wallets for. If any of your pets have had success joining Worldcoin, tell us in a tweet @DLNewsInfo! There\u2019s a growing trend of crypto companies launching their own Ethereum layer 2 chains. But what many don\u2019t realise is how profitable such ventures are. By arbitraging the difference between transaction fees on layer 2 and the cost to send transaction batches to Ethereum, layer 2 operators are raking in the cash. According to data from @niftytable on Dune, Arbitrum, the biggest layer 2 chain, regularly makes over $1 million a month from this arbitrage.

                "body": " High speed-trading giant Jump Trading has been confirmed as the company that propped up the TerraUSD stablecoin one year prior to its collapse, according Securities Exchange Commission filings. The filings state Jump purchased over 62 million UST after the asset lost its peg in May 2021, which restored its $1 parity and allowed founder Do Kwon to credit the recovery to the Terra Luna algorithm, The Wall Street Journal reported. Jump benefited from the arrangement in a deal which enabled the purchase of Luna tokens at a steep discount, and eventually netted the firm $1.28 billion in profits. Last week, an investor initiated a class action lawsuit against both Jump Trading and its president Kanav Kariya for involvement in stabilising Terra. Kwon was granted a \u20ac400,000 bail by a Montenegrin court on Friday after he was arrested in March, accused of attempting to travel with fake passports. He had been a fugitive from the law since Interpol issued a red notice for his arrest in September, following the $60 billion collapse of his crypto empire in May 2022. READ NOW: Do Kwon prosecutor warns of flight risk as crypto fugitive granted \u20ac400,000 bail and house arrest Prominent banks and business groups have backed a US Republican-drafted letter which slammed new custody rules proposed by the SEC. The American Bankers Association and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association supported Republicans\u2019 \u201cstrong concerns\u201d in regards to the new rules, saying they could further harm the digital asset space. The proposed changes could see custodianship of digital assets restricted to federal custodians, a move which crypto firms such as Coinbase fear would jeopardise their deposits, The Block reported. READ NOW: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground Active addresses on the Bitcoin network have dropped to 2021 levels as transaction volumes reach record heights. Bitcoin has seen heightened transaction activity thanks in part to a 2023 rally, as well as hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which allow for NFTs to be minted on the network. One factor that may drive the drop in active users is an eightfold increase in transaction fees since this time last year, as a result of increased network activity, The Block reported. NOW READ: Bitcoin fee surge spurs calls for changes to treat NFTs and meme coins as spam Ethereum liquid staking protocol Lido upgraded to its version two on Monday, which allows users to unstake their Ether from the protocol for the first time. The upgrade saw Lido\u2019s price jump 10%, as users could now verify the platform would function as promised. Lido currently holds 80% of all Ethereum liquid staking derivative market share. The US Secret Service touted the transparency of blockchain technology in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session hosted by Reddit on Monday, and highlighted the agency\u2019s NFT collection. The Secret Service and California cybercrime authorities gave insight into a variety of scam methods, and praised blockchain for providing \u201can amazing opportunity to track the flow of money.\u201d When asked if the agency would consider releasing a token or coin, Secret Service agents pointed to an NFT collection released by the San Francisco field office last year.
