overview: |
  TerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic stablecoin within the Terra ecosystem which aims to maintain a peg to the US Dollar. UST aims to achieve stability through an elastic supply mechanism enabled by the Terra blockchain's native token, Luna, which is minted or sold based on the demand preferences of the UST token. Due to a significant price reduction in the in the LUNA token, has been unable to maintain its peg to the U.S. Dollar.

      - title: Detailed Description of Technology
        value: |
          * TerraUSD  is the decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra blockchain. It is a scalable, yield-bearing coin that is value-pegged to the US Dollar. TerraUSD was created to deliver value to the Terra community and offer a scalable solution for DeDi amid severe scalability problems faced by other stablecoin leaders like DAI. Thus, TerraUSD promises users a higher level of scalability, interest rate accuracy, and interchain usage.
          * TerraUSD provides several benefits that have made it a stand-out stablecoin competitor. Due to its minting mechanism, UST meets the requirements of DeFi protocols that it uses without losing scalability. UST can also be easily added to crypto wallets by simply integrating TerraUSD as a payment method. Another area where TerraUSD has shown its power is Dapps. For example, platforms that mint fungible synthetic assets and track real-life asset prices use UST as a pricing benchmark.
          * TerraUSD (UST) was launched in September 2020 (in collaboration with Bittrex Global) and has since gained the reputation as the most scalable stablecoin. UST can be used in conjunction with LUNA Terra's non-stablecoin crypto, or as a standalone token.
  - title: Governance and Decentralization
    value:
      - title: Governance Structure
        value: |
          Highly centralized and opaque, with significant control by Do Kwon, Terraform Labs, and the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG). Average users held virtually no power.​
      - title: Voting Rights
        value: |
          Limited information available, but implied to be concentrated among the founders and main organizations (LFG, Terraform Labs).
      - title: Token Governance
        value: |
          Lacked transparency and inclusivity, with key decisions made by a small group of insiders without community consent.
      - title: Proposal Submission Process
        value: |
          Not explicitly detailed, but governance appeared to lack mechanisms for broad community participation in decision-making.

      - title: Voting Mechanism
        value: |
          Specifics not provided, but the governance structure suggests a centralized approach to decision-making.

      - title: Token Distribution
        value: |
          Not detailed in the sources, but the aftermath suggests a concentration among insiders and early backers.

      - title: Stakeholder Diversity
        value: |
          Appears limited, with governance decisions and control concentrated among a few entities and individuals.

      - title: On-chain Governance Participation
        value: |
          Limited; significant decisions were made by a small group without broad community engagement or approval.​​

      - title: Reserve Management
        value: |
          Managed by the Luna Foundation Guard, which made unilateral decisions to use reserves in an attempt to stabilize UST, including the selling of significant assets like BTC. Transparency and effectiveness were questioned.​​

      - title: Emergency Decision Making
        value: |
          Decisions made hastily by a small group, including freezing the blockchain and deploying reserves without community input or warning. These actions were not sufficient to prevent the collapse.​​

      - title: Fork Management
        value: |
          Not specifically addressed, but the crisis management indicated a lack of preparedness or effective strategy for handling such fundamental issues.

      - title: Compliance Oversight
        value: |
          Not explicitly mentioned, but the collapse and subsequent legal and regulatory scrutiny highlight potential shortcomings.

      - title: Accountability Mechanisms
        value: |
          The governance structure and response to the crisis suggest a lack of mechanisms for holding decision-makers accountable to the broader community.​​
