                "keypoints": "The stablecoin market capitalisation rebounded to $146 billion, marking a $20 billion increase since August.\nTether's USDT led the growth, surpassing $100 billion in supply.\nNew stablecoins like Ethena's USDe and Curve's crvUSD have emerged, offering high yields and innovative features.",
                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "Ethena\u2019s $400m USDe token sparks renewed debate over stablecoin label",
                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs\u2019 USDe has been available to select investors since December.\nBeginning today, the stablecoin will be available to most people outside the US and Russia.\nAn associated savings product, sUSDe, currently offers 23% annualised yield.",
                "body": " Some of crypto\u2019s largest funds and exchanges are betting on a new dollar-pegged stablecoin backed entirely by Ether and Ether derivatives. Ethena Labs, the company behind the new USDe stablecoin and a yield-bearing version called sUSDe, has raised $14 million in a round that includes crypto venture capital firms Dragonfly, Brevan Howard Digital, and Avon Ventures. An Ethena spokesperson noted that the Brevan Howard funding deal has not closed. Crypto derivatives exchanges Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in an earlier $6 million round led by Dragonfly and Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto exchange BitMEX. Select investors have been able to mint USDe since December. Beginning today, any investor outside the US, Russia, and more than two dozen smaller countries will be able to mint the stablecoin. USDe will try to break into a highly competitive \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 field. Stablecoins are among the most popular real-world applications of crypto technology. They have also been a cash cow for issuers like Tether, who\u2019ve backed their tokens with US Treasuries. Tether posted a net operating profit of more than $6 billion in 2023. Ethena founder Guy Young doesn\u2019t expect USDe to leapfrog Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which have a combined market capitalisation of just under $125 billion. The goal is to create a mass-market stablecoin backed by Ether and versions of staked Ether, rather than real-world assets such as cash and US Treasuries. \u201cWe are definitely not as decentralised as stuff like Liquity,\u201d Young told DL News. \u201c[We\u2019re] not trying to create something that\u2019s perfectly decentralised. What you\u2019re trying to do is just remove collateral from the US banking system and put it into the crypto ecosystem.\u201d Liquity is the company behind the LUSD stablecoin. USDe\u2019s mass-market launch will include integrations with DeFi protocols such as Synthetix, Curve, Convex, and Aave. Other stablecoins, like LUSD and RAI, only accept Ether as collateral. And forthcoming versions of both will accept Ether derivatives like Lido\u2019s stETH. To protect against the volatility of Ether and hold their pegs, existing Ether-backed stablecoins require over-collateralisation: For every $1 of the stablecoin a user borrows, they must deposit more than $1 in Ether. That limits how much a user can borrow and how big the stablecoin can grow. Using a complicated trading strategy, Ethena lets users mint $1 in USDe for about $1.05 worth of Ether. \u2018We basically want to be within the top three stablecoins\u2019 This should create a stablecoin that can expand to a market capitalisation of $5 billion to $10 billion \u2014 much larger than existing Ether-backed competitors, according to Young. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to get as big as something like USDC or USDT, just because there\u2019s natural constraints around how big this product can get, because it relies on the derivative market within crypto being a certain size.\u201d At the same time, it should provide a more decentralised alternative to USDC and USDT, which rely on assets held at banks, which are subject to government oversight and regulation \u2014 in other words, the institutions to which crypto was meant to provide an alternative. \u201cStablecoins are the most important instrument across the entire space,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete joke that DeFi runs literally 100% on centralised stablecoins.\u201d Unlike LUSD or RAI, however, it will rely on old-fashioned businesses for certain functions. Custodians with experience managing crypto, such as Fireblocks and BitGo, have been tapped to hold customer deposits, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s huge centralised components to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Since it became available to some investors in December, USDe\u2019s market capitalisation has topped $225 million, making it one of the 12 largest stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Investors can lock up their USDe to create a yield-bearing token that Ethena has likened to an \u201cinternet bond,\u201d called sUSDe. As of Thursday, the annual yield on sUSDe was a whopping 23%, a figure that recalls the heady days of the Terra stablecoin. Terra imploded in May 2022. Terra\u2019s co-founder, Do Kwon, is currently jailed in Montenegro, awaiting the results of a retrial that could see him extradited to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in those countries want to prosecute him for his role in the collapsed ecosystem. Ethena is not an algorithmic stablecoin like Terra. Some of Ethena\u2019s yield comes from staked Ether. As of Thursday, the yield for staking Ether was just under 4% and is expected to fall as more people stake their Ether. The rest comes from the trading strategy that helps keep USDe at peg: Opening short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely cyclical through the market cycles,\u201d Young said of the yield. At the bottom of a bear market, it would likely be near zero, as in 2022. \u201cAnd then it gets pretty crazy, to 20% to 30% when things are properly heated.\u201d He said that he expects this to remain a competitive advantage over other stablecoins. \u201cThe lesson that we got from Anchor\u2026 was, the demand for $1 which can return higher yield than the rest of the market by a few hundred basis points is not a billion dollars. It\u2019s like 20 [billion],\u201d he said, referring to the Terra-affiliated protocol that generated the failed stablecoin\u2019s now-infamous 20% yield. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much risk was sitting there within Terra and Anchor, $20 billion went in there because there was a slightly higher yield.\u201d Correction: Ethena corrected its announcement to remove Franklin Templeton and PayPal Ventures, which are not participating in the funding round, and to clarify that Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in the company\u2019s previous fund raise. Correction: Ethena also clarified that the Brevan Howard deal has not yet closed. Aleks Gilbert is a New York based reporter covering DeFi. Got a tip? Email him at aleks@dlnews.com."

                "body": " It\u2019s been a sluggish year for venture crypto investment. Despite the total crypto market capitalisation almost doubling since January, VC funding in the sector still lagged behind 2022 levels. This may be about to change as a new year opens with signs venture capital firms are poised to start deploying their cash en masse, said Chris Carapola, co-founder of Curvance, a DeFi protocol. Carapola told DL News that many of the VCs he spoke with ahead of Curvance\u2019s recent $3.6 million fundraising planned to invest aggressively in crypto startups in 2024. \u201cThey expect the best returns will be found in this time period,\u201d he said. At the top of venture capital shopping lists: crypto infrastructure. \u201cInvestors tend to skew toward infrastructure early in the cycle,\u201d Carapola said. It\u2019s easier for venture firms to identify promising infrastructure providers than specific applications, such as DeFi protocols, he said. In December, crypto infrastructure providers such as Shadow, Mocaverse, and Pyth Network have each executed substantial fundraising rounds. And Carapola isn\u2019t the only one to point out the shift. \u201cInfrastructure projects currently receive the lion\u2019s share of venture capital deployment due to the straightforward narrative around \u2018owning the base layer,\u2019\u201d Jack Melnick, head of DeFi at Polygon Labs, told DL News. \u2018Soon we will see users interacting with permissionless smart contract applications through their mobile apps without even knowing it.\u2019 Melnick said many venture firms prefer a \u201cscattershot approach\u201d to investing in infrastructure to make sure they gain exposure to as many promising projects as possible. And there are signs the focus on infrastructure will carry over into the new year. \u201cMuch of our attention throughout 2023 has been on infrastructure and web3 gaming deals, and I don\u2019t foresee us straying too far from this in 2024,\u201d Carl Hua, CTO and investment partner at Shima Capital, told DL News. But infrastructure deals are getting crowded, and it\u2019s getting harder for venture firms to get into funding rounds for promising startups, Hua said. Within infrastructure investment, projects utilising the latest advancements in cryptography are among the most popular. Gleb Dudka, principal at Greenfield Capital, told DL News that he sees plenty of startups working on restaking \u2014 staking the same assets across multiple networks to amplify trust \u2014 and Fully-Homomorphic Encryption, which will allow developers to create private smart contracts on top of public, permissionless blockchains. Examples of restaking projects that have already secured funding include Babylon, a project that lets Proof-of-Stake chains like Ethereum use Bitcoin for staking, and EigenLayer, a protocol built on Ethereum that lets users restake Ether staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Fhenix, the first blockchain powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption, also successfully raised $7.5 million in September. But perhaps the biggest technological advancement creating a stir in venture capital circles is a new transaction technique called intents. Intents let blockchain users hand off transaction creation to a third party without relinquishing full control of the transaction. They will let users generate more efficient and varied kinds of transactions, and allow them to pay transaction fees using any asset in their wallet. Gabriel Gareth Foo, DeFi growth lead at Mantle Network, said that advances in intents, as well as account abstraction and zero-knowledge proofs, will help abstract away much of the complexity involved with interacting with blockchains. Account abstraction will help make transacting with crypto onchain more similar to using debit cards or payment apps like Venmo by letting the apps crypto users interact with handle transaction signing, removing the possibility for human error. Zero-knowledge proofs, which have been a VC favourite for a while, are bringing big improvements in scaling and will help crypto users prove their credentials while keeping their data private and secure. \u201cSoon we will see users interacting with permissionless smart contract applications through their mobile apps without even knowing it,\u201d Foo told DL News. Such a prospect is a top priority, not just for investment firms but also for the broader crypto industry. For years, one of the biggest criticisms of using crypto applications has been its complexity and poor user experience, making it difficult to onboard new users. While the current interest is firmly planted in infrastructure, this won\u2019t be the case forever, said Carapola. \u201cAs some of the new narratives begin to play out in the market, I expect we\u2019ll see more VCs rotate into application-layer products, in particular DeFi,\u201d he said. DeFi protocols Carapola said he expects to gain popularity include those working on staking and restaking, like EigenLayer, and yield-bearing stablecoins, like Ethena Labs\u2019 USDe. Dudka, on the other hand, said Greenfield is keeping an eye on real-world asset protocols and prediction markets. But for projects looking to raise, the path ahead may be more difficult than it has been over the past year. According to Dudka, the number of high-quality projects is increasing, which means more competition for the limited supply of venture capital cash. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "headline": "ONDO soars 140% as tokenisation boom trumps Fed risk \u2014 for now",
                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs\u2019 USDe has been available to select investors since December.\nBeginning today, the stablecoin will be available to most people outside the US and Russia.\nAn associated savings product, sUSDe, currently offers 23% annualised yield.",
                "body": " Some of crypto\u2019s largest funds and exchanges are betting on a new dollar-pegged stablecoin backed entirely by Ether and Ether derivatives. Ethena Labs, the company behind the new USDe stablecoin and a yield-bearing version called sUSDe, has raised $14 million in a round that includes crypto venture capital firms Dragonfly, Brevan Howard Digital, and Avon Ventures. An Ethena spokesperson noted that the Brevan Howard funding deal has not closed. Crypto derivatives exchanges Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in an earlier $6 million round led by Dragonfly and Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto exchange BitMEX. Select investors have been able to mint USDe since December. Beginning today, any investor outside the US, Russia, and more than two dozen smaller countries will be able to mint the stablecoin. USDe will try to break into a highly competitive \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 field. Stablecoins are among the most popular real-world applications of crypto technology. They have also been a cash cow for issuers like Tether, who\u2019ve backed their tokens with US Treasuries. Tether posted a net operating profit of more than $6 billion in 2023. Ethena founder Guy Young doesn\u2019t expect USDe to leapfrog Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which have a combined market capitalisation of just under $125 billion. The goal is to create a mass-market stablecoin backed by Ether and versions of staked Ether, rather than real-world assets such as cash and US Treasuries. \u201cWe are definitely not as decentralised as stuff like Liquity,\u201d Young told DL News. \u201c[We\u2019re] not trying to create something that\u2019s perfectly decentralised. What you\u2019re trying to do is just remove collateral from the US banking system and put it into the crypto ecosystem.\u201d Liquity is the company behind the LUSD stablecoin. USDe\u2019s mass-market launch will include integrations with DeFi protocols such as Synthetix, Curve, Convex, and Aave. Other stablecoins, like LUSD and RAI, only accept Ether as collateral. And forthcoming versions of both will accept Ether derivatives like Lido\u2019s stETH. To protect against the volatility of Ether and hold their pegs, existing Ether-backed stablecoins require over-collateralisation: For every $1 of the stablecoin a user borrows, they must deposit more than $1 in Ether. That limits how much a user can borrow and how big the stablecoin can grow. Using a complicated trading strategy, Ethena lets users mint $1 in USDe for about $1.05 worth of Ether. \u2018We basically want to be within the top three stablecoins\u2019 This should create a stablecoin that can expand to a market capitalisation of $5 billion to $10 billion \u2014 much larger than existing Ether-backed competitors, according to Young. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to get as big as something like USDC or USDT, just because there\u2019s natural constraints around how big this product can get, because it relies on the derivative market within crypto being a certain size.\u201d At the same time, it should provide a more decentralised alternative to USDC and USDT, which rely on assets held at banks, which are subject to government oversight and regulation \u2014 in other words, the institutions to which crypto was meant to provide an alternative. \u201cStablecoins are the most important instrument across the entire space,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete joke that DeFi runs literally 100% on centralised stablecoins.\u201d Unlike LUSD or RAI, however, it will rely on old-fashioned businesses for certain functions. Custodians with experience managing crypto, such as Fireblocks and BitGo, have been tapped to hold customer deposits, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s huge centralised components to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Since it became available to some investors in December, USDe\u2019s market capitalisation has topped $225 million, making it one of the 12 largest stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Investors can lock up their USDe to create a yield-bearing token that Ethena has likened to an \u201cinternet bond,\u201d called sUSDe. As of Thursday, the annual yield on sUSDe was a whopping 23%, a figure that recalls the heady days of the Terra stablecoin. Terra imploded in May 2022. Terra\u2019s co-founder, Do Kwon, is currently jailed in Montenegro, awaiting the results of a retrial that could see him extradited to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in those countries want to prosecute him for his role in the collapsed ecosystem. Ethena is not an algorithmic stablecoin like Terra. Some of Ethena\u2019s yield comes from staked Ether. As of Thursday, the yield for staking Ether was just under 4% and is expected to fall as more people stake their Ether. The rest comes from the trading strategy that helps keep USDe at peg: Opening short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely cyclical through the market cycles,\u201d Young said of the yield. At the bottom of a bear market, it would likely be near zero, as in 2022. \u201cAnd then it gets pretty crazy, to 20% to 30% when things are properly heated.\u201d He said that he expects this to remain a competitive advantage over other stablecoins. \u201cThe lesson that we got from Anchor\u2026 was, the demand for $1 which can return higher yield than the rest of the market by a few hundred basis points is not a billion dollars. It\u2019s like 20 [billion],\u201d he said, referring to the Terra-affiliated protocol that generated the failed stablecoin\u2019s now-infamous 20% yield. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much risk was sitting there within Terra and Anchor, $20 billion went in there because there was a slightly higher yield.\u201d Correction: Ethena corrected its announcement to remove Franklin Templeton and PayPal Ventures, which are not participating in the funding round, and to clarify that Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in the company\u2019s previous fund raise. Correction: Ethena also clarified that the Brevan Howard deal has not yet closed. Aleks Gilbert is a New York based reporter covering DeFi. Got a tip? Email him at aleks@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "VCs appear poised to turn the page on a slow year with a fresh wave of investing in crypto.\nProjects utilising recent advances in technology are at the top of the list.\nCrypto infrastructure is a hot area.",
                "body": " It\u2019s been a sluggish year for venture crypto investment. Despite the total crypto market capitalisation almost doubling since January, VC funding in the sector still lagged behind 2022 levels. This may be about to change as a new year opens with signs venture capital firms are poised to start deploying their cash en masse, said Chris Carapola, co-founder of Curvance, a DeFi protocol. Carapola told DL News that many of the VCs he spoke with ahead of Curvance\u2019s recent $3.6 million fundraising planned to invest aggressively in crypto startups in 2024. \u201cThey expect the best returns will be found in this time period,\u201d he said. At the top of venture capital shopping lists: crypto infrastructure. \u201cInvestors tend to skew toward infrastructure early in the cycle,\u201d Carapola said. It\u2019s easier for venture firms to identify promising infrastructure providers than specific applications, such as DeFi protocols, he said. In December, crypto infrastructure providers such as Shadow, Mocaverse, and Pyth Network have each executed substantial fundraising rounds. And Carapola isn\u2019t the only one to point out the shift. \u201cInfrastructure projects currently receive the lion\u2019s share of venture capital deployment due to the straightforward narrative around \u2018owning the base layer,\u2019\u201d Jack Melnick, head of DeFi at Polygon Labs, told DL News. \u2018Soon we will see users interacting with permissionless smart contract applications through their mobile apps without even knowing it.\u2019 Melnick said many venture firms prefer a \u201cscattershot approach\u201d to investing in infrastructure to make sure they gain exposure to as many promising projects as possible. And there are signs the focus on infrastructure will carry over into the new year. \u201cMuch of our attention throughout 2023 has been on infrastructure and web3 gaming deals, and I don\u2019t foresee us straying too far from this in 2024,\u201d Carl Hua, CTO and investment partner at Shima Capital, told DL News. But infrastructure deals are getting crowded, and it\u2019s getting harder for venture firms to get into funding rounds for promising startups, Hua said. Within infrastructure investment, projects utilising the latest advancements in cryptography are among the most popular. Gleb Dudka, principal at Greenfield Capital, told DL News that he sees plenty of startups working on restaking \u2014 staking the same assets across multiple networks to amplify trust \u2014 and Fully-Homomorphic Encryption, which will allow developers to create private smart contracts on top of public, permissionless blockchains. Examples of restaking projects that have already secured funding include Babylon, a project that lets Proof-of-Stake chains like Ethereum use Bitcoin for staking, and EigenLayer, a protocol built on Ethereum that lets users restake Ether staked on the Ethereum mainnet. Fhenix, the first blockchain powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption, also successfully raised $7.5 million in September. But perhaps the biggest technological advancement creating a stir in venture capital circles is a new transaction technique called intents. Intents let blockchain users hand off transaction creation to a third party without relinquishing full control of the transaction. They will let users generate more efficient and varied kinds of transactions, and allow them to pay transaction fees using any asset in their wallet. Gabriel Gareth Foo, DeFi growth lead at Mantle Network, said that advances in intents, as well as account abstraction and zero-knowledge proofs, will help abstract away much of the complexity involved with interacting with blockchains. Account abstraction will help make transacting with crypto onchain more similar to using debit cards or payment apps like Venmo by letting the apps crypto users interact with handle transaction signing, removing the possibility for human error. Zero-knowledge proofs, which have been a VC favourite for a while, are bringing big improvements in scaling and will help crypto users prove their credentials while keeping their data private and secure. \u201cSoon we will see users interacting with permissionless smart contract applications through their mobile apps without even knowing it,\u201d Foo told DL News. Such a prospect is a top priority, not just for investment firms but also for the broader crypto industry. For years, one of the biggest criticisms of using crypto applications has been its complexity and poor user experience, making it difficult to onboard new users. While the current interest is firmly planted in infrastructure, this won\u2019t be the case forever, said Carapola. \u201cAs some of the new narratives begin to play out in the market, I expect we\u2019ll see more VCs rotate into application-layer products, in particular DeFi,\u201d he said. DeFi protocols Carapola said he expects to gain popularity include those working on staking and restaking, like EigenLayer, and yield-bearing stablecoins, like Ethena Labs\u2019 USDe. Dudka, on the other hand, said Greenfield is keeping an eye on real-world asset protocols and prediction markets. But for projects looking to raise, the path ahead may be more difficult than it has been over the past year. According to Dudka, the number of high-quality projects is increasing, which means more competition for the limited supply of venture capital cash. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?
