                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "headline": "How to track stablecoins",
                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "headline": "Aave stablecoin\u2019s \u2018benevolent temporary dictator\u2019 almost brought it near $1 \u2014 but a midnight deadline approaches",
                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best?

Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday.

TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best?

Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "How to track stablecoins",
                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion. NOW READ: How Ripple\u2019s lobbying sets stage for $3m crypto clash on Capitol Hill ClearLoop, the firm\u2019s off-exchange trading and settlement network that mitigates counterparty risk while offering clients full coverage of digital asset exchanges, has seen strong growth with \u201csignificant increases in trading volumes and clients onboarding\u201d since the end of 2022, according to the firm\u2019s latest update. However, in April, Copper announced a \u201cstrategic realignment\u201d to focus on its custody and prime services solutions, streamlining its business and replacing much of its senior board, as well as making some redundancies.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products. NOW READ: Lure of Treasuries behind Circle stablecoin\u2019s $29bn slump \u2014 and USDC could fall even further In May 2023, MatrixPort announced a flagship partnership with Copper to integrate with ClearLoop.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges. NOW READ: Opinion: Ben McKenzie\u2019s \u2018Easy Money\u2019 holds lessons crypto natives can get behind In November it came one step closer to this goal, working with UBS to launch the world\u2019s first native digital bond with intended dual listing and trading on SIX Digital Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. \u201cThe dual-listed digital bond in effect establishes a migration path for the market to move from issuing traditional securities to issuing natively digital securities on fully regulated blockchain based financial markets infrastructure,\u201d said Newns. Underpinned by technology from global crypto giant Digital Asset, and unlike many others on this lit, Canton isn\u2019t an exchange or a brokerage \u2014 instead, it claims to be the world\u2019s first privacy-enabled open blockchain network, designed for institutional assets and built to \u201cunlock the potential of synchronized financial markets.\u201d A \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d as it calls it, Canton aims to challenge the limitations of current smart contracts.

It also connects current blockchain offerings, such as Deutsche Borse\u2019s D7 post-trade platform and Goldman Sachs\u2019 GS DAP platform, while still retaining privacy and permissioning. Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets. With market data becoming the new gold in conventional markets, it has received less attention in the DeFi space \u2013 but Digital Asset Research aims to change all that.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile. NOW READ: Zodia Custody CEO on leaving Bitstamp, expansion plans, and what clients ask during a crypto winter We\u2019re also seeing new tie-ups with some of the most established players in fintech and payments: such as the recent announcement by PayPal regarding its partnership with Paxos, the leading New York regulated stablecoin, to develop PYUSD, a new stablecoin to support online payments.

                "keypoints": "Online payments giant PayPal's USD-backed token bolsters confidence in blockchain-based payments.\nPayPal's entry comes as US members of Congress push for a landmark stablecoin bill.",
                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start.

PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "headline": "Aave stablecoin\u2019s \u2018benevolent temporary dictator\u2019 almost brought it near $1 \u2014 but a midnight deadline approaches",
                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

Underpinned by technology from global crypto giant Digital Asset, and unlike many others on this lit, Canton isn\u2019t an exchange or a brokerage \u2014 instead, it claims to be the world\u2019s first privacy-enabled open blockchain network, designed for institutional assets and built to \u201cunlock the potential of synchronized financial markets.\u201d A \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d as it calls it, Canton aims to challenge the limitations of current smart contracts.

Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "How to track stablecoins",
                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

It also connects current blockchain offerings, such as Deutsche Borse\u2019s D7 post-trade platform and Goldman Sachs\u2019 GS DAP platform, while still retaining privacy and permissioning. Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets. With market data becoming the new gold in conventional markets, it has received less attention in the DeFi space \u2013 but Digital Asset Research aims to change all that.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

However, in April, Copper announced a \u201cstrategic realignment\u201d to focus on its custody and prime services solutions, streamlining its business and replacing much of its senior board, as well as making some redundancies.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best?

Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "How to track stablecoins",
                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion. NOW READ: How Ripple\u2019s lobbying sets stage for $3m crypto clash on Capitol Hill ClearLoop, the firm\u2019s off-exchange trading and settlement network that mitigates counterparty risk while offering clients full coverage of digital asset exchanges, has seen strong growth with \u201csignificant increases in trading volumes and clients onboarding\u201d since the end of 2022, according to the firm\u2019s latest update. However, in April, Copper announced a \u201cstrategic realignment\u201d to focus on its custody and prime services solutions, streamlining its business and replacing much of its senior board, as well as making some redundancies.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets. With market data becoming the new gold in conventional markets, it has received less attention in the DeFi space \u2013 but Digital Asset Research aims to change all that.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults.

These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

NOW READ: Opinion: Ben McKenzie\u2019s \u2018Easy Money\u2019 holds lessons crypto natives can get behind In November it came one step closer to this goal, working with UBS to launch the world\u2019s first native digital bond with intended dual listing and trading on SIX Digital Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. \u201cThe dual-listed digital bond in effect establishes a migration path for the market to move from issuing traditional securities to issuing natively digital securities on fully regulated blockchain based financial markets infrastructure,\u201d said Newns. Underpinned by technology from global crypto giant Digital Asset, and unlike many others on this lit, Canton isn\u2019t an exchange or a brokerage \u2014 instead, it claims to be the world\u2019s first privacy-enabled open blockchain network, designed for institutional assets and built to \u201cunlock the potential of synchronized financial markets.\u201d A \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d as it calls it, Canton aims to challenge the limitations of current smart contracts.

It also connects current blockchain offerings, such as Deutsche Borse\u2019s D7 post-trade platform and Goldman Sachs\u2019 GS DAP platform, while still retaining privacy and permissioning. Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets. With market data becoming the new gold in conventional markets, it has received less attention in the DeFi space \u2013 but Digital Asset Research aims to change all that.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

Launched in May with over 30 financial services participants (including ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, S&P Global, among others), the network marks a growing momentum towards the tokenisation of \u2018real world\u2019 assets.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022. Institutional adoption is also gathering momentum across the spectrum: from Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital making strategic investments \u2014 such as into new clearing house Cleartoken \u2014 or Standard Chartered\u2019s backing of the digital asset custodian Zodia Custody, while blockchain platforms such as GS DAP are also gaining profile.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "headline": "Aave stablecoin\u2019s \u2018benevolent temporary dictator\u2019 almost brought it near $1 \u2014 but a midnight deadline approaches",
                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange. Led by CEO David Newns, the exchange is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s world-leading crypto framework, and has the ambition of creating a twin-railed service integrating assets across both the digital and traditional exchanges.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve. (Llama Airforce) VOTE: CoW Swap to embark on a 6-month period to test promising fee models PROPOSAL: Aave mulls Solana deployment through Neon EVM VOTE: Uniswap chooses members for its Deployments Accountability Committee Celestia co-founder Mustafa Al-Bassam reminisces about his past exploits as a member of hacker group LulzSec. In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law.

Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "headline": "PayPal goes crypto-native with Curve pool and DeFi \u2018bribes\u2019",
                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " With BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, finally throwing its weight behind Bitcoin, the gates to institutional involvement look to be opening. But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best? From prime brokerage houses to up-and-coming exchanges, new native networks to Wall Street stalwarts, here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the most influential players. Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance. The venture started with an institutional block-trading service for digital assets, Enclave Cross, that allowed players to take large positions without impacting market liquidity. NOW READ: From cute selfies to death threats \u2014 here\u2019s how a fraud victim is fighting the cruelest of crypto crimes This was followed in May 2023 by a spot trading platform for digital assets, connecting buyers and sellers through a central limit order book. Unlike other centralised exchanges, Enclave doesn\u2019t use internal market makers, nor does it operate proprietary trading or take positions against its customers. Since the beginning of the year, Enclave Cross volumes have increased over 1,000% as the platform continues to scale. NOW READ: CoinShares CEO: We can beat the big firms on our own turf The firm uses New York-based accounting firm Marcum to conduct regular audits, to ensure that all funds within Enclave\u2019s FEX are accounted for and not being misused. David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

The firm opened a Zurich office in 2019 with plans to apply for a Swiss banking license, while its venture capital division has been spreading the love, recently leading an angel funding round for OrBit, an institutional crypto liquidity provider for options and structured products.

The world\u2019s first fully regulated digital exchange and central securities depositary, SDX is the digital assets arm of SIX Swiss Exchange, Europe\u2019s third-largest stock exchange.

It offers pricing, benchmarks and volume data, along with due diligence and crypto exchange vetting, reference data and taxonomies, blockchain and crypto yield data, and is used by clients including Bloomberg, Refinitiv and Eurex. In April, DAR also teamed up with crypto indices provider MarketVector to power its index methodologies. Of course, no list of new players can be comprehensive. Lending and credit markets in the digital asset space are becoming more mature since the failure of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and Genesis in 2022.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "keypoints": "Aave\u2019s stablecoin, GHO, has been trading below peg since its debut.\nIn October, DeFi specialist Brice Berdah, also known as TokenBrice, was elected to lead the efforts to return it to peg.\nAfter deploying a variety of novel initiatives, he appears to be on a path to victory.\nBut there's a deadline.",
                "body": " A novel campaign to raise Aave\u2019s de-pegged stablecoin, GHO, to $1 made significant progress over the past week, but was poised to fall short of an \u201cambitious\u201d goal just hours before its midnight deadline. GHO briefly hit $0.99 on Tuesday. It\u2019s trading at $0.983 at the time of writing, just shy of the $0.985 goal set by the campaign\u2019s \u201cbenevolent temporary dictator,\u201d DeFi developer Brice Berdah, better known as TokenBrice. TokenBrice previously pledged to offer to resign from his position if GHO does not reach $0.985 by the end of the month. If it is trading below that price come midnight central European time, a committee will decide whether to accept TokenBrice\u2019s resignation or to ask him to continue his efforts, with a new, end-of-year goal of $1. \u201cIf the objective is met, then there is simply no vote, and [I] keep going for another month and [for] the second target, which is GHO at $1 before 2024,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. If the objective isn\u2019t met, then TokenBrice will offer his resignation, but GHO\u2019s seven-member liquidity committee will still have to vote on it. A month into the campaign, TokenBrice and another member of the committee, longtime Aave contributor Marc Zeller, told DL News it was working, but that the effort to re-peg GHO was only getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever in the history of DeFi where directional liquidity strategies are used in concordance with other initiatives\u201d \u2014 which include upcoming upgrades to GHO itself \u2014 \u201cto repeg an asset,\u201d TokenBrice told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, most often US dollars. They are meant to offer crypto investors and traders refuge from the sector\u2019s volatility while allowing them to keep their assets on the blockchain. They aren\u2019t perfect, however. Stablecoins can deviate from their peg, most famously when multibillion dollar Terra USD fell to near zero in the spring of 2022, plunging the industry into its latest \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d GHO was one of the most anticipated stablecoins to launch this year, along with crvUSD, which is backed by DeFi titan Curve, and PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. But GHO has been trading below its $1 peg almost since the day it launched this past summer, in part because it launched without a mechanism that would allow holders to redeem the token for $1 regardless of its market price. Developers are now working on redemption mechanism, which could launch within two weeks, according to Zeller. GHO was trading just above $0.96 in October, when GHO\u2019s liquidity committee elected TokenBrice to lead the effort to bring it to peg. Those efforts include doling out incentives on three protocols \u2014 Maverick, Bunni and Uniswap \u2014 for people who provide liquidity to pools in which one can trade GHO against a trio of other stablecoins: USDC, USDT, and LUSD. \u201cAt a high level it\u2019s liquidity mining,\u201d TokenBrice said, referring to the practice in decentralised finance of attracting liquidity to certain token pairs by doling out rewards to traders who loan desired tokens to trading pools. \u201cThe way it\u2019s usually done is untargeted,\u201d he continued. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a very precise liquidity shape that is biased toward the buyer side.\u201d The myriad incentives have successfully driven buy pressure for GHO, \u201cpushing the repeg,\u201d TokenBrice wrote in a report published November 23. But it became clear \u201cthat liquidity strategy alone won\u2019t be sufficient to sustainably repeg GHO,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, restoring and maintaining GHO\u2019s peg purely through liquidity strategy would be highly costly.\u201d Meanwhile, the Aave DAO, the digital cooperative that governs Aave, has voted to increase the cost of borrowing GHO from 1.5% to 4.72%. Although GHO fell at the beginning of the campaign, reaching a low of $0.955, it has grown since in fits and starts. \u201cI think without all the coordinated efforts of GLC & DAO the probability of GHO peg would be zero,\u201d Zeller told DL News, referring to the committee and the Aave DAO. Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, and allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets. It had more than $8.7 billion in user deposits as of Wednesday. GHO is minted when Aave users borrow it against crypto collateral worth more than the GHO being borrowed. As of Tuesday, there were almost 35 million GHO tokens in circulation, backed by more than $70 million worth of crypto. One challenge in improving liquidity around GHO remains: a large pool on decentralised exchange Balancer in which one can trade GHO against USDC and USDT. \u201cIt acts as an essentially selling reserve of GHO as GHO price goes upward,\u201d TokenBrice said. Despite the efforts of TokenBrice and the committee, the biggest boost may have come from something outside the committee\u2019s scope: a proposal to use GHO in Aave\u2019s \u201csafety module,\u201d a vault of locked-away tokens that are distributed to users in the event the protocol suffers a shortfall. That would make the stablecoin more attractive to would-be buyers, by giving them a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings. Users who lock up, or \u201cstake,\u201d their GHO would earn 12% to 15% yield on the staked GHO, according to the proposal, authored by Zeller. That, in addition to the fact that GHO can only be purchased on secondary markets at the moment \u2014 it recently hit a 35 million cap \u2014 may have contributed to its sharp jump Tuesday, according to Zeller. \u201cAs you can\u2019t mint GHO, smart money realised they can both get repeg money + a slot in [staked GHO] for 12-15% yield,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cAs StkGHO recently entered governance pipeline, I think it was the spark among many factors.\u201d TokenBrice agreed. \u201cThere was definitely some form of excitement and FOMO \u2014 there were large buys that pushed the price, and more people jumping in on the GHO long trade,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cWhat matters most is that the price appreciation is so far sustained, and I think this is where the directional liquidity plays its most significant role.\u201d Another major solution is around the corner: the ability to redeem GHO for $1 on Aave, even when it is trading for more or less than $1 on secondary markets. Stablecoin experts have attributed GHO\u2019s de-peg, in part, to the fact that it couldn\u2019t be redeemed for $1. Redemption would allow traders to arbitrage any deviation from its peg \u2014 say, minting it for $1 and selling it for $1.01 \u2014 creating sell or buy pressure that quickly brings it back to peg. GHO\u2019s redemption mechanism, the \u201cGHO stability module,\u201d is set to debut in the next two weeks, according to Zeller. But it will primarily benefit GHO when it is over-peg, he said. Some version of the liquidity incentives used over the past month may be necessary to make sure GHO stays there. \u201cGetting back to peg is only half of the journey,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cStaying there is as important and GHO needs to be liquid enough to maintain peg even with large buy/sells.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is our New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

But looking beyond the big guns like BlackRock and Fidelity, there is a wealth of innovation at smaller or more obscure firms. We\u2019ve all seen the big gestures: most notably the U-turn from BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink, who in 2017 called Bitcoin \u201can index of money laundering\u201d but in July, he hailed it as a tool that could \u201crevolutionise finance.\u201d NOW READ: Why Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in crypto is a sign of wider adoption As the gulf between retail and institutional crypto activity finally narrows, who is bridging that gap best?

Enclave claims to be the creator of the first fully encrypted exchange, or FEX, set up to combine the best bits of both centralised and decentralised finance.

David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, said: \u201cWith the digital asset industry moving further towards maturity, providing utility to professional and retail traders alike remains a key aspect of our core mission.\u201d One of the biggest players on the list, Copper is a digital asset infrastructure provider that offers custody, trading and prime broking solutions, alongside its ClearLoop network and Walled Garden infrastructure, which cover around 96% of the global crypto market. Founded in 2018 with buy-in from some crypto veterans and based in London, the firm became a crypto unicorn in 2022 with a Series C funding round led by Barclays Ventures and Tiger Global Management that valued the firm at around $2 billion.

                "body": " When PayPal this week introduced a stablecoin it was a clear sign that traditional fintech players still see a lot of upside in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. More precisely, PayPal\u2019s move was a vote of confidence in stablecoins, an instrument that has been under pressure in recent months: the market cap for Circle\u2019s USDC is down more than 40% since March, investors question the integrity of Tether\u2019s reserves, and lawmakers in the US Congress weighing a landmark stablecoin law. Yet PayPal, a platform with 400 million active accounts and half the marketshare on online payments, has the clout to reset the debate. And that has crypto leaders, and even its rivals, excited. \u201cIt is a strong signal that near-instant, borderless, and programmable payments in the form of stablecoins are here to stay,\u201d Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, told DL News in a statement. NOW READ: Why Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap plunges to two-year low At least that\u2019s the hope. Ever since Bitcoin hit the market 14 years ago, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have dreamed of building a blockchain-based payments network that would provide consumers and businesses with a transparent, affordable, and speedy means of transferring money. The best part: no intermediaries such as banks. With the introduction of PYUSD, a stablecoin backed by the US dollar, the industry might have taken one step closer on that quest. But here\u2019s the rub: PayPal released scant details on how the stablecoin will work, and there\u2019s little evidence, at least for now, that it can overcome the obstacles that have so far prevented blockchain companies from reinventing traditional online payment systems. \u2018This the type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time.\u2019 Launched on the Ethereum network, the stablecoin is available for select US users starting this week. PayPal plans on rolling the token out fully over the next couple of months. Early users may send person-to-person payments and fund purchases with the stablecoin. It will shortly be compatible with Venmo, the popular payment app in the US. The big idea at work here is erecting a bridge between fiat currency and web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, the company said in the announcement. NOW READ: Why 150m Binance customers ignore regulatory woes and pile in anyway The stablecoin is designed to \u201creduce friction\u201d for users in virtual environments, potentially alluding to web3 payments and the metaverse \u2013 something blockchain technology has struggled to fine-tune with crypto wallets notoriously not user-friendly. PayPal also wants to facilitate \u201cfast transfers of value to support friends and family, send remittances or conduct international payments, enable direct flows to developers and creators, and foster the continued expansion into digital assets by the largest brands in the world,\u201d according to the announcement. Amid all the news, there is no mistaking the sense that PayPal sees a huge opportunity in ironing out all the wrinkles that have prevented blockchain technology from truly revolutionising payments. Crypto wallets are unwieldy, blockchain firms are struggling to cope with regulatory pressure, and bandwidth issues and gas fees continue to plague Ethereum and its ilk. That all means it\u2019s harder than ever to see how blockchain-based payment platforms garner mass market adoption. \u2018It\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.\u2019 But PayPal already solved a lot of structural problems in reinventing the way we pay for things online. Monerium founder Sveinn Valfells said PayPal\u2019s adoption of stablecoins is \u201cpaving the way for the first trillion dollars in fiat stablecoin market capitalisation.\u201d Valfells isn\u2019t alone in this thinking. Paypal\u2019s stablecoin on the market is \u201cthe type of movement that can cause the sort of mass adoption that frankly, the crypto space has been talking about for a long time,\u201d said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at blockchain intelligence firm, TRM Labs. Making blockchain technology available to the masses has been an ambition for its advocates but a challenge from the start. For the past decade, crypto has emerged from the crevices of the internet, pushed forward by a digitally native generation but often submerged in complex interfaces, technical jargon and cliquish cults. NOW READ: Get ready. These seven bills may decide the future of crypto in the US \u201cWe need that moment where it becomes frictionless, where people see the technology and they get really comfortable with engaging in it,\u201d Redbord said. \u201cAnd this move by PayPal today is potentially that type of moment.\u201d Circle\u2019s Allaire sent out a flurry of tweets on Monday, welcoming the payments firm to the space \u2013 and most notably seeking to dispel fears over USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin. The firm has issued $5 billion USDC over the past month, and redeemed $6.6 billion, Allaire told his followers. Essentially, there\u2019s $1.6 billion less USDC in circulation now, and it\u2019s been falling for months. Ever since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, the firm\u2019s market capitalisation has been shrinking. The broader stablecoin market has dipped nearly 10% over the past few months, with the total market cap falling to around $124 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The stablecoin market cap has contracted almost 10% this year even as other cryptocurrencies rallying. (DeFi Llama) Crypto \u2014 and, in particular, stablecoins which are deemed the gateway into decentralised finance \u2014 are climbing lawmakers\u2019 agendas. PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch comes ten days after the US House Committee on Financial Services passed a Republican-led bill for stablecoin legislation with a 34-16 vote, and limited support from Democrats. Paypal\u2019s move drew comment from the US House Committee on Financial Services Chairman, Patrick McHenry. The Republican Congressman grabbed the opportunity to push his stablecoin bill forward. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation [\u2026] We must finish the job.\u201d The bill will still need to pass a full house vote and make its way through the Senate to become law. If passed, stablecoin issuers would be regulated by financial firms like banks and would need to keep one-to-one reserves of safe assets backing the stablecoin. NOW READ: Stablecoin laws could give US an edge \u2014 if they ever get off the ground But PayPal\u2019s established importance in the financial payments landscape may crank the heat under the pot. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, is glad to see an Ethereum-based stablecoin gaining support. \u201cThere has been regulatory pressure against the use of public blockchains, especially amongst banks,\u201d he told DL News. There may now be a shift since at the start of the year, the Biden administration highlighted \u201cthe imperative of separating risky digital assets from the banking system.\u201d While the American stablecoin bill is still on the drawing board, the New York Department of Financial Services has laid out clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers. That may be why PayPal and Paxos are regulated there. \u201cEntities like Paxos have taken a trust-based approach in the US,\u201d Monerium\u2019s Sveinn Valfells told DL News, adding that they are \u201cbacked by high-quality segregated assets.\u201d NOW READ: Macron stokes Paris crypto scene with tax breaks and clear rules, but will VCs remain wary? Paxos\u2019 approach mirrors European e-money rules, Valfells added, this \u201cenhances user trust and ensures the stability of the stablecoin\u2019s value,\u201d he noted. E-money rules in Europe ensure that issuers offer to redeem them one-to-one with a matching fiat currency and that they are fully backed by reserves. Other stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, are based on non-homogeneous state money transmission licence, \u201cwhich may not offer the same level of protection as e-money or trust-based approaches,\u201d Valfells concluded. \u201cBeing pegged to the US dollar, backed by US dollar deposits, short-term treasuries or cash equivalents: that was already a requirement from the New York DFS to be a stablecoin issuer or registered in the state or licensed in the state,\u201d Redbord said. PayPal also holds a so-called Bitlicense since 2022, a virtual currency licence the New York DFS established in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy licence to get and PayPal benefits from having one,\u201d Perkins said.
