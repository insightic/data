PYUSD activated the Curve automated market maker in December and is seeking deployment on Aave. Despite the initial buzz around PayPal entering the stablecoin market with PYUSD, it faces challenges in trade volumes compared to leading stablecoins. To combat this, Paxos, the entity behind PYUSD, has partnered with Trident Digital to improve on-chain liquidity. The Curve platform launched the FRAXPYUSD liquidity pool, which has become the third-largest on Curve with $135 million in TVL. The pool includes FRAX Finance's collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, FRAX, and allows FRAX holders to swap for PYUSD for use on the PayPal app. Aave is currently voting on whether to onboard PYUSD into its Ethereum pool, with the initial vote ending on January 11, 2024. If successful, Paxos and associated parties plan to seed the liquidity pool with $5-10 million.",

Through PayPal's cross-border payments platform, Xoom, users can convert PYUSD to USD and send money to approximately 160 countries without any transaction fees.

PayPal launched PYUSD on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2023, in collaboration with Paxos, aiming to facilitate cost-effective international payments and remittances. The launch was well-received in the crypto industry, with several prominent exchanges listing PYUSD. However, in November, PayPal received a subpoena from the SEC regarding its stablecoin.",

PayPal launched PYUSD on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2023, in collaboration with Paxos, aiming to facilitate cost-effective international payments and remittances. The launch was well-received in the crypto industry, with several prominent exchanges listing PYUSD. However, in November, PayPal received a subpoena from the SEC regarding its stablecoin.",

PayPal aims to offer more cost-effective international money transfer solutions, citing a World Bank report on the high global average cost of sending money. The fintech company is also looking to increase the adoption of its stablecoin, launched last year, and establish itself as a trusted entity in digital assets. This move comes as the stablecoin market heats up, with competitors like Ripple launching their own stablecoins for enterprise clients.

Starting Thursday, through its cross-border payments service Xoom, customers can convert PYUSD to USD and send money to recipients in approximately 160 countries without transaction fees. PayPal aims to offer more cost-effective international money transfer solutions, citing a World Bank report on the high global average cost of sending money. The fintech company is also looking to increase the adoption of its stablecoin, launched last year, and establish itself as a trusted entity in digital assets. This move comes as the stablecoin market heats up, with competitors like Ripple launching their own stablecoins for enterprise clients. Currently, Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC are leading in terms of supply.",
