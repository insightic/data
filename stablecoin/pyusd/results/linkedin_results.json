As we pull preliminary numbers from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, I'm feeling proud of the pivotal role thatPayPalplays in the world and the impact we\u2019re having in our customers' lives:\n\n\ud83d\udd35  We processed approximately 400M transactions\n\ud83d\udd35  We put more than $8M back in our customers\u2019 pockets with cash back and savings (more than $2M on Black Friday alone!)\n\ud83d\udd35  Cyber Monday was the single largest shopping day of the year so far with approximately $5.8B in TPV and more than 87M transactions (61K transactions per minute!) \n\nSetting numbers aside, it makes it very real for us when we hear firsthand from entrepreneurs likeJanine Mastrorilliowner of New York-based handbag company Independent Reign, andLeon Leong \u6881\u5fd7\u5eb7, founder of Singapore-based watchmaker BOLDR Supply Co.\u00a0how critical this time has been for them and their gratitude for the role our team plays in supporting them 365 days/year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo to the PayPal team: THANK YOU for your hard work and dedication.
