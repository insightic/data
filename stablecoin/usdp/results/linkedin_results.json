Congratulations toBam Azizi,Adam Israeland the entire Mesh team \u2013 we are thrilled to support the work you\u2019re doing to foster an open, connected, and secure financial ecosystem. Read more in Fortune here:https://lnkd.in/e-dZAtUpAt PayPal Ventures, we believe that user ownership and asset portability will become critical building blocks of product innovation as financial services continues to evolve, and Mesh is a clear leader in this dynamic landscape.

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

It outlines the engagement goals, findings, and provides a structured analysis of the project's code and security practices. The most critical issues identified are the susceptibility of auctions to transaction-reordering attacks and the non-production readiness of ABIEncoderV2. Additionally, the k-dss repository being out of sync and the incomplete use of checkRely in auth-checker are highlighted as significant concerns. To improve, the report suggests regular dry runs of response plans to develop \"muscle memory\" and ensure the team is prepared for various scenarios.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers.

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles #LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

Financial markets are complex and highly regulated. Our thesis has always been that institutional adoption of blockchain and stablecoins presents enormous benefits for billions of people around the world, but these products, services and companies must be overseen by prudential regulatory authorities. That\u2019s the only way to ensure consumer safety and security. That is why we established Paxos and our products under prudential regulatory supervision. \n\nThe recent piece from the Bloomberg Editorial Board calls to light why stablecoins should be issued by regulated entities. We agree - which is why Paxos and its products are regulated by prudential regulators like the New York Department of Financial Services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. Unregulated leaders in the space like Tether and Circle pose significant risks to investors, financial markets and national security\u2013something each has shown multiple times. Without oversight, you cannot maintain trust. \u201cTrust, but verify,\u201d is an adage everyone should follow, just like Paxos. \n\nWe recognize the pivotal role that regulatory clarity plays in shaping the future of the crypto industry, which is why we have actively sought consistent standards of regulation and advocated for state pathways. I\u2019m glad to see some momentum with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT 21) bill, but now that we\u2019ve started the ball rolling, it\u2019s time to pick up the pace. Delays in providing clear regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation and market growth and forcing firms like Paxos to invest overseas. That only puts the United States at risk of falling behind in the industry that will determine the future of the global financial system.",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",
