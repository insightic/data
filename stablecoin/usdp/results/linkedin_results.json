Our investment in Mesh was made almost entirely in PayPal USD (PYUSD), the Ethereum-based stablecoin thatPayPallaunched last year that is 100% backed by U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents. This marks the first time that we\u2019ve used PYUSD as the funding instrument for aPayPal Venturesinvestment! Congratulations toBam Azizi,Adam Israeland the entire Mesh team \u2013 we are thrilled to support the work you\u2019re doing to foster an open, connected, and secure financial ecosystem. Read more in Fortune here:https://lnkd.in/e-dZAtUpAt PayPal Ventures, we believe that user ownership and asset portability will become critical building blocks of product innovation as financial services continues to evolve, and Mesh is a clear leader in this dynamic landscape.

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",

An and her team provide and maintain internal APIs for Paxos, as well as build out infrastructures to support workflows for different chains, such as transfers, withdrawals and deposits. Hear from An about why blockchain development was a fit for her:\n\n\"My parents work in the finance industry, and one of the pain points for them is always the very, very slow speed of moving assets around,\" said An. \"At Paxos, I feel like I can help be a part of the shift to invigorate and improve on the current financial system, and that makes me very excited.\"\n\nShe also described some of the unique challenges of being a blockchain developer:\n\n\"We work with different chains all the time, so there are always new challenges every single day. You're never seeing two blockchains that are exactly the same, as some have benefits on one side and some have benefits on the other. It's always really nice to be able to do the research and readings into the blockchains to make informed decisions based on the data you've collected.\"\n\nAs for tips to anyone looking to break into blockchain development, here\u2019s what An had to say:\n\n\"First off, I would recommend reading up on the blockchain that you're interested in. It\u2019s important to get in the habit of staying on top of the latest research, as blockchain technologies are ever-growing and ever-changing. Next, set up a local chain. Many blockchains are open-source and have very quick guides of how to get started in their development, so playing around with a local chain in your own time can really help you get familiar with it.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most fun thing about working at Paxos?\n\n\"It's fun working at Paxos because my team is amazing. We lean on each other, support each other and cover for each other in times of need. I'm working with some amazing engineers here who teach me a lot about development, deployments and how to make our system more secure to protect the assets of our customers. That is something that I've never experienced anywhere else, and I am really grateful to be able to learn that here at Paxos.\"\n\nVisitpaxos.com/careersto explore our open roles#LifeAtPaxos",
