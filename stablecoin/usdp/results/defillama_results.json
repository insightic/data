Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts. Businesses can use token extensions to establish specific rules governing who can interact with their tokens, for example by limiting transfers to people who have passed anti-money laundering and know-your-customer checks. Despite growing institutional interest in crypto, some companies are staying on the sidelines, fearful of inadvertently stepping over legal boundaries amid a regulatory onslaught. \u201cA growing number of enterprises are interested in the benefits of blockchain, but want to ensure that they can adopt the technology in a responsible way that adheres to their internal compliance processes,\u201d Amira Valliani, Head of Policy at the Solana Foundation, said in a statement. Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount. This makes sensitive financial information like payroll private, allowing individuals to receive their salary in crypto without broadcasting the amount for the world to see. Token extensions are one of several upgrades to come out of Token 2022, a Solana Foundation-led effort to make development on the blockchain more intuitive and less fragmented. Token 2022 has, among other things, unified fungible and non-fungible tokens on Solana, ensuring seamless interoperability with smart contracts and wallets within the Solana ecosystem. However, transitioning to the Token 2022 standard requires the burning of previous standard tokens and is a user opt-in process, presenting a strategic decision for token creators and users alike.

The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million.

Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain.

Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said.

The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "headline": "Solana rolls out 13 new token extensions in bid to lure finance institutions onchain",
                "keypoints": "Solana's new token extensions add features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts.\nMany of the extensions will help companies deploying tokens on Solana adhere to their internal compliance processes.\nOthers allow users to make the amount of a token sent in a transaction private.",
                "body": " In a bid to attract traditional businesses to the Solana blockchain, a series of 13 new features, dubbed token extensions, give companies more control and flexibility over tokens they issue. Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts. Businesses can use token extensions to establish specific rules governing who can interact with their tokens, for example by limiting transfers to people who have passed anti-money laundering and know-your-customer checks. Despite growing institutional interest in crypto, some companies are staying on the sidelines, fearful of inadvertently stepping over legal boundaries amid a regulatory onslaught. \u201cA growing number of enterprises are interested in the benefits of blockchain, but want to ensure that they can adopt the technology in a responsible way that adheres to their internal compliance processes,\u201d Amira Valliani, Head of Policy at the Solana Foundation, said in a statement. Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount. This makes sensitive financial information like payroll private, allowing individuals to receive their salary in crypto without broadcasting the amount for the world to see. Token extensions are one of several upgrades to come out of Token 2022, a Solana Foundation-led effort to make development on the blockchain more intuitive and less fragmented. Token 2022 has, among other things, unified fungible and non-fungible tokens on Solana, ensuring seamless interoperability with smart contracts and wallets within the Solana ecosystem. However, transitioning to the Token 2022 standard requires the burning of previous standard tokens and is a user opt-in process, presenting a strategic decision for token creators and users alike. Looking forward, Solana\u2019s roadmap includes the introduction of further Zero-Knowledge features in Spring 2024. Ryan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings.

More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts.

Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount.

Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam.

Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14.

The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said.

Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered.

By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure.

In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered.

Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets.

By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation.

More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated.

                "body": " In a bid to attract traditional businesses to the Solana blockchain, a series of 13 new features, dubbed token extensions, give companies more control and flexibility over tokens they issue. Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts. Businesses can use token extensions to establish specific rules governing who can interact with their tokens, for example by limiting transfers to people who have passed anti-money laundering and know-your-customer checks. Despite growing institutional interest in crypto, some companies are staying on the sidelines, fearful of inadvertently stepping over legal boundaries amid a regulatory onslaught. \u201cA growing number of enterprises are interested in the benefits of blockchain, but want to ensure that they can adopt the technology in a responsible way that adheres to their internal compliance processes,\u201d Amira Valliani, Head of Policy at the Solana Foundation, said in a statement. Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount. This makes sensitive financial information like payroll private, allowing individuals to receive their salary in crypto without broadcasting the amount for the world to see. Token extensions are one of several upgrades to come out of Token 2022, a Solana Foundation-led effort to make development on the blockchain more intuitive and less fragmented. Token 2022 has, among other things, unified fungible and non-fungible tokens on Solana, ensuring seamless interoperability with smart contracts and wallets within the Solana ecosystem. However, transitioning to the Token 2022 standard requires the burning of previous standard tokens and is a user opt-in process, presenting a strategic decision for token creators and users alike. Looking forward, Solana\u2019s roadmap includes the introduction of further Zero-Knowledge features in Spring 2024. Ryan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount. This makes sensitive financial information like payroll private, allowing individuals to receive their salary in crypto without broadcasting the amount for the world to see. Token extensions are one of several upgrades to come out of Token 2022, a Solana Foundation-led effort to make development on the blockchain more intuitive and less fragmented. Token 2022 has, among other things, unified fungible and non-fungible tokens on Solana, ensuring seamless interoperability with smart contracts and wallets within the Solana ecosystem.

The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation.

Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts. Businesses can use token extensions to establish specific rules governing who can interact with their tokens, for example by limiting transfers to people who have passed anti-money laundering and know-your-customer checks. Despite growing institutional interest in crypto, some companies are staying on the sidelines, fearful of inadvertently stepping over legal boundaries amid a regulatory onslaught. \u201cA growing number of enterprises are interested in the benefits of blockchain, but want to ensure that they can adopt the technology in a responsible way that adheres to their internal compliance processes,\u201d Amira Valliani, Head of Policy at the Solana Foundation, said in a statement.

Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions.

In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week.

Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation.

                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Token extensions give token issuers on solana added features that normally would have only been possible with smart contracts.

Because these features are set at the token level, companies no longer have to spend significant amounts of time and money to add a specific functionality for their token by creating their own smart contracts. Although the announcement was only made official today, there are already a number of Solana ecosystem projects using these new features. Of the 13 extensions, two of the more important give token issuers the ability to dictate how users can interact with a token or hide how much is being transferred between users, according to Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam. Paxos, a project building regulated blockchain and digital asset products, has added several extensions to their dollar-pegged stablecoin USDP, which has a total circulating supply of over 360 million. Using these token extensions, Paxos can transfer or remove tokens from anyone who holds the USDP token. Furthermore, they have the ability to blacklist any entities who are acting nefariously or may fall under sanctions, a feature already used by the two largest stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on Ethereum. Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14. By combining token extensions, projects can create permissioned ecosystems within a permissionless blockchain. For example, a business can limit transfers to users who have passed know-your-customer checks or require users to include a memo with each transfer, adding additional context to transactions. Companies can use extensions featuring zero-knowledge proof technology to pay employees without revealing the total transfer amount. This makes sensitive financial information like payroll private, allowing individuals to receive their salary in crypto without broadcasting the amount for the world to see. Token extensions are one of several upgrades to come out of Token 2022, a Solana Foundation-led effort to make development on the blockchain more intuitive and less fragmented.

Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Some Solana ecosystem projects have already integrated these new features, including popular wallet providers Phantom and Solflare and a popular Telegram trading bot and decentralised exchange, Fluxbeam.

Another stablecoin issuer, GMO Trust, plans to use some of these token extensions in a pair of upcoming stablecoins, which are set to launch on February 14.

The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?
