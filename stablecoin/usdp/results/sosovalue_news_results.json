However, the repetitive and impersonal nature of the posts could be improved by incorporating more personalized and varied content to enhance engagement and authenticity. Further investigation could focus on verifying the sources and authenticity of the posts to ensure they are not part of a more subtle automated manipulation strategy.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "title": "Crypto Biz: Rising Demand for US Dollar-Denominated Digital Assets and Regulatory Challenges",
                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ). Before you go: More than $100 billion has been raised for cryptocurrency startups since the end of May 2014. Looking back over the past four years, the ceiling and floor have been raised despite continuing peaks and troughs.

Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                    "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ). Before you go: More than $100 billion has been raised for cryptocurrency startups since the end of May 2014.

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets.

The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The new iteration of the Solana token program was built in collaboration with large, regulated institutions and uses a standard interface to connect to Solana applications, allowing the creation of specialized tooling and functionality at the token level. The first Token Extensions were included as part of the v.1.17 release of the Solana Labs validator client. Solana's Token Extensions provide ready-to-use enhanced token capabilities on Solana, representing the future of tokenization. The extensions were developed expressly for builders in a variety of industries, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments. Some stablecoin issuers employing Solana have already begun to implement Token Extensions. Paxos, for example, recently used permanent delegation, a metadata pointer, transfer hooks, and other features to launch its USDP stablecoin.",

Solana's stablecoin market share has grown to nearly 32%, up from 1.2% a year ago. This surge in activity began in October and has continued to rise, with a 650% increase since then. Ethereum remains the leader in stablecoin transfers with a market share of over 33%, but Solana is quickly catching up. Tron is the third largest blockchain for stablecoin transfers. The increase in stablecoin volume on Solana has been attributed to USDC transfers, which have reached the highest levels in over a year. Additionally, Paxos's regulated stablecoin USDP has launched on Solana. The overall DeFi activity on Solana has also increased, with the total value locked reaching its highest level since September 2022 at $1.36 billion. Despite the positive developments in stablecoin transfers and DeFi activity, Solana's price has seen a decline, falling 2% over the weekend and 25% from its December 2023 high.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

Currently, USDP has a market capitalization of $134 million and is the 13th largest stablecoin by market cap.

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

Since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in March this year and then declined, I have noticed the following points: \u2022 USDT supply increased by 14%; \u2022 USDC supply increased by 13%; \u2022 DAI supply increased by 12%; \u2022 PYUSD supply increased by 300% (mainly on the Solana chain). However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

Despite this, USDP remains redeemable for $1 on Paxos, with the company emphasizing that it always values USDP at $1 and offers 24/7 1:1 redemption via APIs. The depegging incident occurred during a significant market cap increase for USDP, which briefly rose from a $140 million market cap to $181 million when the coin hit $1.29, before falling back to $140 million as it regained parity. Currently, USDP has a market capitalization of $134 million and is the 13th largest stablecoin by market cap.

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                    "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ). Before you go: More than $100 billion has been raised for cryptocurrency startups since the end of May 2014. Looking back over the past four years, the ceiling and floor have been raised despite continuing peaks and troughs.

However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

                    "body": "Pricing aggregators caused the PAX Dollar (USDP) stablecoin to temporarily depeg from its $1 parity, according to a Paxos spokesperson. The issue arose from sharp price spikes on certain trading venues, which then impacted the price on pricing aggregators. Despite this, USDP remains redeemable for $1 on Paxos, with the company emphasizing that it always values USDP at $1 and offers 24/7 1:1 redemption via APIs. The depegging incident occurred during a significant market cap increase for USDP, which briefly rose from a $140 million market cap to $181 million when the coin hit $1.29, before falling back to $140 million as it regained parity. Currently, USDP has a market capitalization of $134 million and is the 13th largest stablecoin by market cap. The incident highlights the importance of traders using limit orders and closely monitoring the order book on trading platforms to avoid similar risks.",

The first Token Extensions were included as part of the v.1.17 release of the Solana Labs validator client. Solana's Token Extensions provide ready-to-use enhanced token capabilities on Solana, representing the future of tokenization. The extensions were developed expressly for builders in a variety of industries, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments.

Ethereum remains the leader in stablecoin transfers with a market share of over 33%, but Solana is quickly catching up. Tron is the third largest blockchain for stablecoin transfers. The increase in stablecoin volume on Solana has been attributed to USDC transfers, which have reached the highest levels in over a year. Additionally, Paxos's regulated stablecoin USDP has launched on Solana. The overall DeFi activity on Solana has also increased, with the total value locked reaching its highest level since September 2022 at $1.36 billion.

Since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in March this year and then declined, I have noticed the following points: \u2022 USDT supply increased by 14%; \u2022 USDC supply increased by 13%; \u2022 DAI supply increased by 12%; \u2022 PYUSD supply increased by 300% (mainly on the Solana chain). However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and other news. The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

                "body": "This week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Hashdex filing for a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., and more stablecoins delisting in Europe. More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first Token Extensions were included as part of the v.1.17 release of the Solana Labs validator client. Solana's Token Extensions provide ready-to-use enhanced token capabilities on Solana, representing the future of tokenization. The extensions were developed expressly for builders in a variety of industries, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments.

However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ). Before you go: More than $100 billion has been raised for cryptocurrency startups since the end of May 2014.

However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

The first Token Extensions were included as part of the v.1.17 release of the Solana Labs validator client. Solana's Token Extensions provide ready-to-use enhanced token capabilities on Solana, representing the future of tokenization. The extensions were developed expressly for builders in a variety of industries, including stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and payments. Some stablecoin issuers employing Solana have already begun to implement Token Extensions. Paxos, for example, recently used permanent delegation, a metadata pointer, transfer hooks, and other features to launch its USDP stablecoin.",

Solana's stablecoin market share has grown to nearly 32%, up from 1.2% a year ago. This surge in activity began in October and has continued to rise, with a 650% increase since then. Ethereum remains the leader in stablecoin transfers with a market share of over 33%, but Solana is quickly catching up. Tron is the third largest blockchain for stablecoin transfers. The increase in stablecoin volume on Solana has been attributed to USDC transfers, which have reached the highest levels in over a year. Additionally, Paxos's regulated stablecoin USDP has launched on Solana. The overall DeFi activity on Solana has also increased, with the total value locked reaching its highest level since September 2022 at $1.36 billion. Despite the positive developments in stablecoin transfers and DeFi activity, Solana's price has seen a decline, falling 2% over the weekend and 25% from its December 2023 high.",

Since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in March this year and then declined, I have noticed the following points: \u2022 USDT supply increased by 14%; \u2022 USDC supply increased by 13%; \u2022 DAI supply increased by 12%; \u2022 PYUSD supply increased by 300% (mainly on the Solana chain). However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

However, not all stablecoin supplies are increasing, with the total supply only growing by 2%, mainly due to: \u2022 BUSD supply decreased by 17%; \u2022 USDP supply decreased by 42% (possibly due to Binance changing its stablecoin strategy). With the decline in government bond yields, I expect stablecoin supply to further increase. This is because investors may allocate more funds to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If this trend continues (or even accelerates), we may see the total supply of stablecoins firmly surpassing its historical high in the coming months, which could boost Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.",

The first deadline for complying with new rules under the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is approaching, slashing more stablecoins from local markets. On June 26, Bitstamp announced the delisting of Tether\u2019s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, to comply with the new rules. The exchange was one of the first to list the coin in 2021. In the same vein, Uphold recently notified its European users that six popular stablecoins would no longer be supported on its platform: Tether ( USDT ), Dai ( DAI ), Frax Protocol (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Binance has also revamped its stablecoin strategy . The exchange is now classifying stablecoins into \u201cregulated\u201d and \u201cunauthorized\u201d coins based on their compliance with the new regulations. Coins labeled as \u201cunauthorized\u201d will be available on its platform in a \u201csell-only\u201d mode, said Binance, adding that only a few stablecoins would meet MiCA requirements at present. The MiCA regulation will be implemented in two phases, starting on June 30, 2024, and fully coming into force by Dec. 30, 2024. The framework classifies crypto assets into three main categories: electronic money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and other crypto assets such as utility tokens. Under the regulation, stablecoins are considered a concern for monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Currently, stablecoins have a market capitalization of over $163 billion. \u201cWith clear rules and guidelines, the regulation will provide the investor protections needed while contributing to financial stability and market integrity across the EU,\u201d said Olivier Carr\u00e9, deputy managing partner at PwC Luxembourg. Some crypto firms have criticized the European regulation . \u201cVery few banks accept this type of business in Europe. It\u2019s already very difficult to get just one!\u201d said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino during an interview in May, referencing stablecoin reserve requirements of 60% in cash deposits at several banks. This week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores the departure of Jump Crypto\u2019s CEO, Animoca Brands\u2019 return to public markets, the corporate dispute between Riot and Bitfarms, and more. Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, has resigned amid a United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation. Jump Crypto is the digital asset subsidiary of Jump Trading. According to Kariya\u2019s social media announcement, he intends to focus on personal relationships and reading while searching for his next venture. Jump Crypto has been involved in several controversies, including the Wormhole bridge hack in 2022, the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, and concerns about exposure to FTX. Gaming and metaverse conglomerate Animoca Brands is reportedly considering returning to the public market after delisting from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in March 2020. This time, the company is targeting friendlier jurisdictions, specifically analyzing Hong Kong and the Middle East. Animoca has been holding meetings with investment banks but has not chosen a location or hired an adviser. Back in March 2020, the ASX delisted Animoca after expressing concerns about its compliance with listing rules, specifically those relating to investments in crypto and blockchain-related businesses. Riot Platforms wants to replace three Bitfarms board members , claiming a 14.9% stake in the company. Previously, Bitfarms announced a shareholder rights plan to prevent further stock purchases by Riot. Rather than continue purchasing Bitfarm shares, Riot planned to replace three of the company\u2019s board members and \u201cremove any additional director\u201d appointed after its announcement. The plan to overhaul the Bitfarms\u2019 board was the latest development in Riot\u2019s plans to move in on Bitfarms. In May, Riot offered to acquire the mining firm for $950 million. Brazilian neobank Nubank has partnered with Lightspark to offer the Bitcoin Lightning Network to its 100 million customers in Latin America. Lightspark will also integrate the Universal Money Address standard, a payment system built on top of Lightning that gives users an email-like address to transfer money. Lightspark has been building Lightning Network infrastructure for enterprises since it was co-launched in 2022 by former PayPal president David Marcus.

More crypto firms are seeking to capitalize on the demand for United States dollar-denominated digital assets. Tether, the company behind the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin, recently announced its synthetic dollar backed by gold and pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move comes just a few days after Assymetry released its synthetic dollar , afUSD, with an elastic supply based on market conditions. New tokens mimicking the U.S. dollar have risen since the launch of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar , USDe. The protocol, launched in February 2024, has amassed over $3.4 billion in total locked assets over four months, according to DefiLlama. Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar has shaken stablecoin players and emphasizes a strong global market demand for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. Another move in a similar fashion is also seen in the growing size of tokenized funds offering exposure to U.S. Treasurys. BlackRock\u2019s recently launched USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) had over $462.7 million in assets as of June 19, while Franklin Templeton\u2019s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) held $357.6 million in assets. Overall, $1.5 billion in U.S. Treasurys have now been tokenized \u2014 the majority in the last few months. As traditional finance moves onchain, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Hashdex\u2019s filing for a combined spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Coinbase\u2019s pre-launch market, Ripple\u2019s challenges with regulators in the U.S., as well as more stablecoins exiting Europe. Hashdex has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a combined spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF aims to track the daily market movements according to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, maintaining a composition of approximately 70.54% Bitcoin and 29.46% Ether. Both Coinbase and BitGo will serve as custodians for the BTC and ETH assets. Hashdex is still required to file and receive SEC approval on an S-1 application. Coinbase International has announced support for a pre-launch market , enabling users to trade futures of tokens and coins yet to be listed on the exchange. This new feature allows for early trading activities before the official launch of these digital assets, allowing traders to engage with upcoming tokens in advance\u200b. The feature will be available to institutional investors via Coinbase International and retail traders via Coinbase Advanced. Pre-launch market assets are capped at an initial margin of 50%, or 2x leverage, and a notional position limit of $50,000 per token. With the move, Coinbase is following in the footsteps of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Bitget and OKX, which already provide similar services. The SEC has criticized Ripple\u2019s request for a lower penalty in their ongoing legal battle. Ripple had argued for a significantly reduced penalty of no more than $10 million, citing the SEC\u2019s earlier settlement with Terraform Labs as a benchmark. The SEC suggested that based on Ripple\u2019s gross profits and considering a similar ratio to Terraform\u2019s case, it would imply a penalty of $102.6 million for Ripple rather than the suggested $10 million. Overall, the SEC is seeking nearly $2 billion from Ripple, which includes $198.2 million in prejudgment interest, $876.3 million in civil penalty and another $876.3 million in disgorgement. Digital asset platform Uphold has announced that it will delist six stablecoins by July 1 due to the impending implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation by the European Union. This move is part of a broader trend among cryptocurrency platforms, which are adjusting their operations to comply with new regulatory standards set by MiCA. The six stablecoins are USDT, Dai ( DAI ), Frax (FRAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Pax dollar (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD). Users holding these stablecoins must convert them to a different cryptocurrency before June 28; otherwise, they will be automatically converted into USD Coin ( USDC ).

Giancarlo, who served as a commissioner at the CFTC from 2013 to 2017 and chair from 2017 to 2019, is known for his work on the Digital Dollar Project and as an advisory board member for the Chamber of Digital Commerce. His expertise is expected to guide Paxos in revolutionizing traditional finance. Paxos, the company behind the U.S. dollar-pegged Pax Dollar (USDP) and issuer of PayPal\u2019s PYUSD stablecoin, faces regulatory scrutiny, with the SEC issuing a Wells notice for issuing BUSD as an unregistered security and New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services targeting the firm over its stablecoin.",

Despite this, USDP remains redeemable for $1 on Paxos, with the company emphasizing that it always values USDP at $1 and offers 24/7 1:1 redemption via APIs. The depegging incident occurred during a significant market cap increase for USDP, which briefly rose from a $140 million market cap to $181 million when the coin hit $1.29, before falling back to $140 million as it regained parity. Currently, USDP has a market capitalization of $134 million and is the 13th largest stablecoin by market cap.
