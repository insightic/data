details:
  - title: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
    value: |
      1. USDL is a US dollar-backed stablecoin that distributes yield from its cash and cash equivalent reserves to eligible wallets holding it every day.
      2. USDL is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain that can always be redeemed at a rate of 1 USDL = 1 US dollar from Paxos International.
  - title: How is USDL different from other stablecoins
    value: |
      1. USDL distributes yield generated from its cash and cash equivalent reserves to all eligible holders.
      2. US dollars backing USDL are invested by Paxos International in cash equivalent assets that generate yield.
      3. An Ethereum smart contract built by Paxos International proportionally increases the value of USDL in eligible wallets holding it every day. Holders of USDL see their USDL balance increase daily and do not need to take any action.
  - title: Backing Assets
    value: |
      1. Cash.
      2. Debt securities with up to three month residual maturity issued by government or central bank of pegged currency, or organizations that are of both a government and international character with a minimum credit rating of “AA-”.
      3. Reverse repurchase agreements that are overcollateralized by US Government securities and entered into with counterparties that are not Paxos International affiliates and are adequately creditworthy (as defined by the FSRA credit rating requirements), with final maturities not to exceed one business day.
      4. Institutional Stable NAV USD Government Money Market Funds domiciled in non-US jurisdictions, public money market funds (MMFs) composed of direct investments in cash, US Government securities (USGs) and/or overnight repurchase agreements overcollateralized by USGs.
  - title: Mint & Burn
    value: |
      The mint operation requires the requisite amount of US dollars in the USDL reserve account before Paxos International mints USDL. <br />
      To remove US dollars from the USDL reserve account, Paxos International must first burn the requisite USDL.
  - title: Reserve Investment Policy
    value: |
      Paxos International is required by its applicable FSRA Regulation to have a Reserve Portfolio Management Policy which establishes the fundamental principles and core processes used to manage the USDL Stablecoin Reserve Portfolio.
