Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, with a total circulating amount of a little under $26.9 billion, according to information available on DeFiLlama. Circle\u2019s decision to discontinue USDC on the Tron network was the result of an enterprise-wide approach that involved its business organization, compliance, and other functions at the company, a Circle spokesperson told Blockworks. \u201cThis action aligns with our efforts to ensure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe \u2014 characteristics that make it the leading regulated digital dollar on the internet,\u201d the Circle spokesperson said. Customers of Circle Mint will have the option to transfer their USDC tokens from Tron to other networks or directly redeem USDC on Tron for fiat currency. Other retail users who hold USDC can transfer their tokens through exchanges or on/off-ramp services. When reached for comment, a Tron spokesperson did not directly address Circle\u2019s discontinuation of support. \u201cWe respect the decision of the countless developers who chose Tron to create world-class products and services,\u201d the spokesperson said. USDT remains the most dominant stablecoin on the Tron network today, making up over 96% of the network\u2019s total stablecoin market cap. The price of the network`s native toke, TRX, has remained relatively stable following the news, currently trading at $0.139, according to CoinGecko. Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, has previously been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT). Additional charges were also handed to the founder for market manipulation through wash-trading. Circle, in November, strongly refuted allegations of banking Justin Sun or financing Hamas, as outlined in a letter to US Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sherrod Brown, D-Oh. The company clarified it had severed all ties with Sun and his entities by February 2023 and challenged claims of the company\u2019s involvement in illicit financial activities, emphasizing its commitment to legal compliance and transparency.",

                    "body": "In a recent development within the cryptocurrency sphere, Panos Mekras, a renowned blockchain advisor specializing in the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has sparked discussions regarding the integration of USDC onto the XRPL. Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

USDT remains the most dominant stablecoin on the Tron network today, making up over 96% of the network\u2019s total stablecoin market cap. The price of the network`s native toke, TRX, has remained relatively stable following the news, currently trading at $0.139, according to CoinGecko. Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, has previously been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT). Additional charges were also handed to the founder for market manipulation through wash-trading. Circle, in November, strongly refuted allegations of banking Justin Sun or financing Hamas, as outlined in a letter to US Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sherrod Brown, D-Oh. The company clarified it had severed all ties with Sun and his entities by February 2023 and challenged claims of the company\u2019s involvement in illicit financial activities, emphasizing its commitment to legal compliance and transparency.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",
