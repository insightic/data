Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, with a total circulating amount of a little under $26.9 billion, according to information available on DeFiLlama. Circle\u2019s decision to discontinue USDC on the Tron network was the result of an enterprise-wide approach that involved its business organization, compliance, and other functions at the company, a Circle spokesperson told Blockworks. \u201cThis action aligns with our efforts to ensure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe \u2014 characteristics that make it the leading regulated digital dollar on the internet,\u201d the Circle spokesperson said. Customers of Circle Mint will have the option to transfer their USDC tokens from Tron to other networks or directly redeem USDC on Tron for fiat currency. Other retail users who hold USDC can transfer their tokens through exchanges or on/off-ramp services. When reached for comment, a Tron spokesperson did not directly address Circle\u2019s discontinuation of support. \u201cWe respect the decision of the countless developers who chose Tron to create world-class products and services,\u201d the spokesperson said. USDT remains the most dominant stablecoin on the Tron network today, making up over 96% of the network\u2019s total stablecoin market cap. The price of the network`s native toke, TRX, has remained relatively stable following the news, currently trading at $0.139, according to CoinGecko. Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, has previously been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT). Additional charges were also handed to the founder for market manipulation through wash-trading. Circle, in November, strongly refuted allegations of banking Justin Sun or financing Hamas, as outlined in a letter to US Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sherrod Brown, D-Oh. The company clarified it had severed all ties with Sun and his entities by February 2023 and challenged claims of the company\u2019s involvement in illicit financial activities, emphasizing its commitment to legal compliance and transparency.",

                    "body": "In a recent development within the cryptocurrency sphere, Panos Mekras, a renowned blockchain advisor specializing in the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has sparked discussions regarding the integration of USDC onto the XRPL. Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

USDT remains the most dominant stablecoin on the Tron network today, making up over 96% of the network\u2019s total stablecoin market cap. The price of the network`s native toke, TRX, has remained relatively stable following the news, currently trading at $0.139, according to CoinGecko. Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, has previously been charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT). Additional charges were also handed to the founder for market manipulation through wash-trading. Circle, in November, strongly refuted allegations of banking Justin Sun or financing Hamas, as outlined in a letter to US Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sherrod Brown, D-Oh. The company clarified it had severed all ties with Sun and his entities by February 2023 and challenged claims of the company\u2019s involvement in illicit financial activities, emphasizing its commitment to legal compliance and transparency.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

Base has seen significant growth, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) surging from $500M to $1.0B in March. However, concerns about decentralization persist, as Base operates with a single sequencer controlled by Coinbase, raising questions about its autonomy.

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Similarly, the USDC/Euro pair also saw a sudden collapse, with the parity dropping to 0.75 Euro. The cause of these sudden price collapses remains unclear, but one possible explanation is a lack of liquidity, where the market sell orders outnumber the pending buy orders, causing the price to drop to the nearest sufficient bid point.

This achievement puts it significantly ahead of its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC), which has a market cap of approximately $28.8 billion, creating a gap of about $71 billion between the two. The growth of USDT has been remarkable, with a more than 35% increase in its market cap from the beginning of 2023 to the end of the year, and it continues to show potential for further expansion. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, highlighted the company's efforts to hedge against volatility by adding around $4 billion in excess to its USDT consolidated reserves. Additionally, USDT's availability on 14 blockchains and protocols, notably on the Tron network, contrasts with Circle's recent decision to cease support for USDC on Tron.

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

Solana will be the second non-AVM chain to introduce CCTP, following its debut on Noble's main network in November 2023. Circle's CCTP is expected to be a game-changer for the blockchain industry.",

According to BlockBeats news on March 21, based on DeBank data, the address marked as \"BlackRock Digital Asset Fund\" by crypto KOL @IAMDCINVESTOR has received various crypto assets including ROCK worth $15,000, USH worth $12,800, RIO worth $12,000, ETH worth about $9,700, and 26 NFT assets. BlockBeats previously reported that BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), on a public blockchain. BUIDL aims to provide accredited investors the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar income through tokenization, which is a focus of BlackRock\u2019s digital asset strategy. The fund is expected to bring significant benefits to investors by enabling the issuance and trading of ownership rights on the blockchain, expanding investor access to on-chain products, providing instant and transparent settlement, and allowing cross-platform transfers. However, BlockBeats notes that transfers to this address are voluntary actions by crypto users and have nothing to do with BlackRock or the tokenized fund.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform.

This achievement puts it significantly ahead of its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC), which has a market cap of approximately $28.8 billion, creating a gap of about $71 billion between the two. The growth of USDT has been remarkable, with a more than 35% increase in its market cap from the beginning of 2023 to the end of the year, and it continues to show potential for further expansion. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, highlighted the company's efforts to hedge against volatility by adding around $4 billion in excess to its USDT consolidated reserves. Additionally, USDT's availability on 14 blockchains and protocols, notably on the Tron network, contrasts with Circle's recent decision to cease support for USDC on Tron. The overall increase in stablecoin spot trading volumes indicates a growing interest in crypto assets among investors.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL.

Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, highlighted the company's efforts to hedge against volatility by adding around $4 billion in excess to its USDT consolidated reserves. Additionally, USDT's availability on 14 blockchains and protocols, notably on the Tron network, contrasts with Circle's recent decision to cease support for USDC on Tron. The overall increase in stablecoin spot trading volumes indicates a growing interest in crypto assets among investors.",

The program will distribute ARB rewards to users who bridge their USDC using the Wormhole Connect Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and use the protocol to bridge USDC to Aave, Compound, and Beefy, or hold it in the bridging address. Users can participate by bridging USDC to Arbitrum using the Portal Bridge, providing USDC on Compound, Aave, or Beefy to continue earning ARB rewards (optional), and claiming their ARB rewards. Rewards will accumulate every seven days for up to three months and can be claimed within one year. Any unclaimed rewards will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO.",

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

This development is linked to the launch of the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on the Solana mainnet, scheduled for March 26. The CCTP, designed by Circle, aims to facilitate USDC transfers between blockchain networks through native burning and minting, enhancing capital efficiency and reducing the need for trust in cross-chain transactions. Developers can leverage CCTP to create cross-chain applications involving trading, loans, payments, NFTs, and more. Solana will be the second non-AVM chain to introduce CCTP, following its debut on Noble's main network in November 2023. Circle's CCTP is expected to be a game-changer for the blockchain industry.",

BUIDL aims to provide accredited investors the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar income through tokenization, which is a focus of BlackRock\u2019s digital asset strategy.

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL.

While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform.

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility.

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform.

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Mekras, known for his insights into blockchain technologies, took to social media to shed light on the absence of USDC on this ledger. Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility.

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility. As discussions continue to unfold, stakeholders await Ripple's response and potential interventions to expedite the integration of USDC into XRPL, signaling a pivotal moment for the XRP ecosystem.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

The fund is expected to bring significant benefits to investors by enabling the issuance and trading of ownership rights on the blockchain, expanding investor access to on-chain products, providing instant and transparent settlement, and allowing cross-platform transfers. However, BlockBeats notes that transfers to this address are voluntary actions by crypto users and have nothing to do with BlackRock or the tokenized fund.",

                    "body": "BlackRock, the asset management giant, has become the owner of at least $40,000 in memecoins and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) after onchain sleuths discovered one of its wallets connected to a new tokenization fund. A $100 million USD Coin (USDC) deposit was made on Ethereum on March 15, a day after the firm filed to offer its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund via a partnership with Securitize. Unnamed crypto users have sent at least 40 coins and 25 NFTs to the BlackRock-labeled address since March 19, including Bitcoin-based Ordinals Pepe (PEPE) coin and a CryptoDickButts S3 NFT. Among the transferred tokens were 500,000 Unshething_Token (USH) and 10,000 Realio Network (RIO) tokens, with the largest values at $13,755 and $11,600 respectively. The RIO token, a real-world asset tokenization coin, has seen a 47% increase since being transferred to BlackRock. The firm also received large quantities of MOG coin, VoldemortTrumpRobotnik-10Neko (Ethereum), and Shina Inu (SHI), along with notable NFTs like Chungos and KaijuKingz. BlackRock's involvement in the cryptocurrency space has evolved significantly since 2017, with CEO Larry Fink's changing stance on Bitcoin and blockchain. The firm filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, which has been approved and is capturing significant volumes in the ETF market. BlackRock is now focusing on tokenizing financial assets on Ethereum, aiming to place every stock and bond on a general ledger. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, tickered \"BUIDL,\" will offer eligible investors the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the fund through Securitize Markets, LLC.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Addressing the issue, Mekras emphasized the significance of USDC and EURC (Euro Coin) integration for the progress of projects like Anodos on the XRPL platform. He disclosed his proactive approach by reaching out directly to Circle, the company behind USDC, to inquire about the delay in issuing a stablecoin on XRPL. Mekras's observations underscore a broader concern within the XRP community regarding Ripple's role in facilitating integrations and developments on the XRPL. While acknowledging Ripple as a pivotal entity in the XRPL ecosystem, Mekras hinted at the need for diversification and independence from Ripple's influence to foster growth and innovation. Moreover, Mekras hinted at a potential bottleneck in XRPL's development, attributing it to the prevalent perception of Ripple as the sole driving force behind the platform. He highlighted the need for greater awareness within the XRP community and beyond, regarding the broader ecosystem and functionalities of XRPL. Mekras's insights shed light on the intricacies surrounding XRPL's evolution and the imperative for collaborative efforts to broaden its utility.

Circle officially announced on April 11 a new smart contract functionality that would allow BUIDL holders to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC. Circle\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the frictionless transfer of BUIDL shares in exchange for USDC to Circle on the secondary market. According to the announcement, the smart contract will enable \u201cnear-instant\u201d BUIDL off-ramp that serves investors 24/7. Launched by BlackRock in March 2024, BUIDL is a tokenized fund that operates on the Ethereum blockchain to offer U.S. dollar yields through tokenization. BUIDL allows investors to purchase tokens representing shares in the fund, which invests in assets like U.S. Treasury bills. The fund is referred to as the \u201cDigital Liquidity Fund\u201d because it is digitized in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and operates as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL. The new investment tool is the first tokenized fund introduced by BlackRock, which is also the operator of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, tokenization of real-world assets is a rapidly emerging product category. \u201cTokenizing assets is but one important dimension of solving investor pain points. USDC enables investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction,\u201d Allaire stated.

Circle has previously expanded access to USDC across various blockchains but has also halted efforts, such as ceasing USDC minting on the Tron blockchain on Feb. 21, without providing a specific reason.

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key.

The migration, which began last October in response to community feedback, aims to complete the transition for a better user experience and wider adoption of the Polygon PoS network.

Circle officially announced on April 11 a new smart contract functionality that would allow BUIDL holders to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC. Circle\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the frictionless transfer of BUIDL shares in exchange for USDC to Circle on the secondary market. According to the announcement, the smart contract will enable \u201cnear-instant\u201d BUIDL off-ramp that serves investors 24/7. Launched by BlackRock in March 2024, BUIDL is a tokenized fund that operates on the Ethereum blockchain to offer U.S. dollar yields through tokenization. BUIDL allows investors to purchase tokens representing shares in the fund, which invests in assets like U.S. Treasury bills. The fund is referred to as the \u201cDigital Liquidity Fund\u201d because it is digitized in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and operates as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL. The new investment tool is the first tokenized fund introduced by BlackRock, which is also the operator of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.

Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Circle officially announced on April 11 a new smart contract functionality that would allow BUIDL holders to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC. Circle\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the frictionless transfer of BUIDL shares in exchange for USDC to Circle on the secondary market. According to the announcement, the smart contract will enable \u201cnear-instant\u201d BUIDL off-ramp that serves investors 24/7. Launched by BlackRock in March 2024, BUIDL is a tokenized fund that operates on the Ethereum blockchain to offer U.S. dollar yields through tokenization. BUIDL allows investors to purchase tokens representing shares in the fund, which invests in assets like U.S. Treasury bills. The fund is referred to as the \u201cDigital Liquidity Fund\u201d because it is digitized in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and operates as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL. The new investment tool is the first tokenized fund introduced by BlackRock, which is also the operator of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, tokenization of real-world assets is a rapidly emerging product category. \u201cTokenizing assets is but one important dimension of solving investor pain points. USDC enables investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction,\u201d Allaire stated.

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

Circle officially announced on April 11 a new smart contract functionality that would allow BUIDL holders to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC.

BUIDL allows investors to purchase tokens representing shares in the fund, which invests in assets like U.S. Treasury bills. The fund is referred to as the \u201cDigital Liquidity Fund\u201d because it is digitized in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and operates as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL.

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

Developers can leverage CCTP to create cross-chain applications involving trading, loans, payments, NFTs, and more. Solana will be the second non-AVM chain to introduce CCTP, following its debut on Noble's main network in November 2023. Circle's CCTP is expected to be a game-changer for the blockchain industry.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

Unnamed crypto users have sent at least 40 coins and 25 NFTs to the BlackRock-labeled address since March 19, including Bitcoin-based Ordinals Pepe (PEPE) coin and a CryptoDickButts S3 NFT. Among the transferred tokens were 500,000 Unshething_Token (USH) and 10,000 Realio Network (RIO) tokens, with the largest values at $13,755 and $11,600 respectively. The RIO token, a real-world asset tokenization coin, has seen a 47% increase since being transferred to BlackRock. The firm also received large quantities of MOG coin, VoldemortTrumpRobotnik-10Neko (Ethereum), and Shina Inu (SHI), along with notable NFTs like Chungos and KaijuKingz. BlackRock's involvement in the cryptocurrency space has evolved significantly since 2017, with CEO Larry Fink's changing stance on Bitcoin and blockchain. The firm filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, which has been approved and is capturing significant volumes in the ETF market. BlackRock is now focusing on tokenizing financial assets on Ethereum, aiming to place every stock and bond on a general ledger. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, tickered \"BUIDL,\" will offer eligible investors the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the fund through Securitize Markets, LLC.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

This migration allows for minting and redeeming USDC directly on Polygon PoS, promising improved capital efficiency and user experience. The initiative is supported by DeFi protocols, bridges, and NFT marketplaces, encouraging the transition from the bridged version of USDC (USDC.e) to the native one. The native USDC on Polygon PoS offers more functionality and a better experience than its bridged counterpart, being fully reserved, always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars, and supported by Circle account and its APIs. The migration, which began last October in response to community feedback, aims to complete the transition for a better user experience and wider adoption of the Polygon PoS network. Additionally, Polygon has received new upgrades, including the Elderberry upgrade on Polygon zkEVM and the Dencun upgrade, which benefits from Ethereum's execution logic improvements.",

Circle officially announced on April 11 a new smart contract functionality that would allow BUIDL holders to transfer their shares to Circle for USDC. Circle\u2019s smart contract functionality enables the frictionless transfer of BUIDL shares in exchange for USDC to Circle on the secondary market. According to the announcement, the smart contract will enable \u201cnear-instant\u201d BUIDL off-ramp that serves investors 24/7. Launched by BlackRock in March 2024, BUIDL is a tokenized fund that operates on the Ethereum blockchain to offer U.S. dollar yields through tokenization. BUIDL allows investors to purchase tokens representing shares in the fund, which invests in assets like U.S. Treasury bills. The fund is referred to as the \u201cDigital Liquidity Fund\u201d because it is digitized in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and operates as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL. The new investment tool is the first tokenized fund introduced by BlackRock, which is also the operator of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. According to Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, tokenization of real-world assets is a rapidly emerging product category. \u201cTokenizing assets is but one important dimension of solving investor pain points. USDC enables investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction,\u201d Allaire stated. This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",

Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels.

CCTP aims to overcome traditional bridging solutions' drawbacks by eliminating additional trust assumptions and reducing gas fees. Despite the launch, the price of SOL, Solana's native token, has remained stable at $190.4.",

                "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

This move comes in response to a surge in DeFi applications building on zkSync, creating a demand for stablecoins that support the blockchain. With this addition, USDC is now supported on 16 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum. The zkSync technology, which utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and rollups, allows for transactions at record speed and low cost at layer 2, while maintaining transaction integrity without disclosing supporting evidence. As of April 9, 2024, the zkSync ecosystem boasts over 180 decentralized applications and more than 5.7 million unique active wallet addresses in the last 30 days. USDC on zkSync can be redeemed one-for-one for U.S. dollars directly via Circle or through digital wallets and exchanges, and can also be swapped for other USDCs via cross-chain bridges. Circle has previously expanded access to USDC across various blockchains but has also halted efforts, such as ceasing USDC minting on the Tron blockchain on Feb. 21, without providing a specific reason. This decision followed the U.S. SEC's lawsuit against Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation for offering unregistered securities and conducting manipulative trading, which Sun denies.

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

Binance, which had earlier disabled support for its stablecoin BUSD citing regulatory heat, introduced FDUSD as a replacement. Despite being less than a year old, FDUSD has rapidly grown to become the fourth largest stablecoin by market cap. The stablecoin market continues to evolve, with Tether (USDT) leading in market capitalization, followed by USDC and DAI.",

                    "body": "A hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Dolomite's smart contracts, absconding with $1.8 million in USDC, prompting the exchange's development team to issue mitigation measures. A recent report from blockchain security platform CertiK reveals a significant security breach within the Dolomite crypto exchange. An old contract, once utilized by Dolomite, became the gateway for a hacker to abscond with approximately $1.8 million worth of USD Coin (USDC). Dolomite, a decentralized exchange and money market protocol, initially launched on Ethereum in 2019 before migrating to the Arbitrum network in 2022. Despite transitioning away from Ethereum, users can still access its Ethereum version utilizing developer tools owing to the immutable nature of smart contracts. The fact that the hackers were able to gain access to the protocol and steal funds from the auditors despite precautionary measures is being considered a serious security concern. The exploited contract, named 'DolomiteMarginProtocol,' harbored vulnerabilities stemming from permissions granted to the owner, predating its elimination in 2020. The assailant capitalized on a function termed \"CallFunction,\" enabling arbitrary calls despite the presence of a \"NoEntry\" modifier designed to thwart reentrancy attacks. Despite the intended safeguarding through the \"NoEntry\" modifier, the attacker circumvented restrictions by leveraging a function housed in a separate contract, 'SoloMargin,' effectively bypassing security measures. This exploit allowed the attacker to siphon funds from users, with all pilfered assets eventually funneled into a certain wallet address and subsequently deposited into Tornado Cash. To reduce the damage, Dolomite's development team advised users to revoke approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address starting with 0xE2466, which was implicated in the breach. While users solely interacting with the current version on Arbitrum are deemed unaffected, the team has disabled the compromised contract as an added precaution. Nonetheless, users have been urged to revoke approvals to mitigate potential risks. This incident adds to a series of breaches occurring in March within the crypto space. Notably, on March 11, the Unizen protocol on Ethereum suffered losses exceeding $2.1 million due to an approval exploit. Similarly, on March 15, Mozaic Finance lost over $2.4 million, which was attributed to a compromised private key. Ultimately, the attack on Dolomite's smart contracts highlights the ongoing risks decentralized platforms face. Therefore, with the industry fast evolving into a significant contender in the global economy, maintaining a high level of awareness and taking proactive steps is crucial to protecting user funds.",

                "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",

                    "body": "The $1.4 billion USDC deposit on Coinbase has reignited predictions of yet another Bitcoin pump. Bitcoin has been trading around $70,000 after a major retracement that dragged the leading crypto asset below $63,000 briefly. Despite a few flat trading sessions, data reveals that a pump could be in the offing that could further trigger a new wave of buying pressure. CryptoQuant\u2019s latest analysis reveals a remarkable surge in USDC deposits, surpassing $1.4 billion on Coinbase. Stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital assets market, facilitating seamless transactions. An influx of USDC into the market can signify an increased willingness to purchase because it is pegged to the US dollar, providing stability and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. When there\u2019s a surge in USDC entering the market, it typically means that investors or traders are converting their fiat currency (such as US dollars) into USDC to participate in trading. This influx of USDC can indicate confidence in the market and a readiness to deploy capital into various assets, including Bitcoin. It is also important to note that a similar deposit occurred only once before, on January 9th, 2023, which preceded a notable price surge from a cycle low of $16,800, representing a crucial bottom. Such a significant deposit could signal a similar turning point, potentially impacting the current market cycle positively, according to the CryptoQuant analyst \u2018Maartunn\u2019 in his latest update. \u201cSeveral hours ago, the largest influx of USDC ever recorded occurred, with over $1.4 billion of USDC deposited on Coinbase. This sizable deposit signals potentially significant buying pressure, as these stablecoins can be utilized to purchase Bitcoin.\u201d Further validating the bullish momentum is the continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs after flipping positive from five consecutive days of outflows earlier this month. Additionally, the foray of new participants, such as Hashdex, into the already crowded space to offer such funds to investors, both big and small, depicts a continued demand. Earlier CryptoQuant report also revealed the sharp rise in monthly demand for Bitcoin from 40,000 to over 213,000 BTC in 2024. As demand surged, the supply of the crypto asset, on the other hand, decreased to 2.7 million, marking the lowest liquidity levels. Besides the increase in ETF holdings, large-scale investors, known as whales, also greatly influenced this trend.",
