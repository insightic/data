Converting those pesos to US dollars is a desirable way to retain the value of their hard-earned money, but it\u2019s not feasible to open US dollar bank accounts because of government capital controls. \n\nThat\u2019s whereLemonand#USDCcome in. \ud83d\udc47\n\nLemon is an Argentina-based crypto exchange and digital wallet that operates in seven Latin American countries. They integrate traditional finance with crypto for their 2.2M users to empower them with better financial services.\n\nBy making a stable currency available to users and allowing them to easily spend it in their day-to-day lives, Lemon grew 200x in a period of just 2 years. Partnering with Circle to educate users about the benefits of USDC, Lemon saw USDC use double in the 3rd quarter of 2023 alone. \ud83d\udd25\n\nRead the full story to see how Lemon uses USDC:https://lnkd.in/g2bXmc4X",

Nearly a quarter of this population is aged 14 or younger, giving LatAm another key advantage over other global regions with aging populations\n\ud83d\udc49 Developers: there are nearly a million developers in the region who are active in offshore development, much of which is outsourced by American companies\n\ud83d\udc49 Regulatory support: Fintech is also widely supported by policymakers, since it provides financial authorities with new tools to manage risks and compliance. LatAm fintech sector has recently doubled in size and now features approximately 2500 platforms\n\nTaken together, Latin America\u2019s well-established market demand, policy support and widespread dollar usage make the region a natural fit for broader stablecoin adoption. \n\nRead the full Executive Insights bySpencer SpinnellandRachel Mayerto learn more about our vision of internet-native financial infrastructure in LatAm.",

LatAm fintech sector has recently doubled in size and now features approximately 2500 platforms\n\nTaken together, Latin America\u2019s well-established market demand, policy support and widespread dollar usage make the region a natural fit for broader stablecoin adoption. \n\nRead the full Executive Insights bySpencer SpinnellandRachel Mayerto learn more about our vision of internet-native financial infrastructure in LatAm.",
