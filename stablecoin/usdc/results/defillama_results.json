                "headline": "DeFi exchange dYdX attracts stakers amid $41bn in trading volume",
                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "headline": "Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade will make DeFi a lot cheaper to use",
                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "These three Solana protocols offer yields of 24% or higher on stablecoin deposits",
                "keypoints": "Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer annual yields of 39%, 35%, and 24% on USDC deposits, respectively.\nUtilisation rates on USDC pools are relatively high, likely because of the demand for leverage and points farming.",
                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Wormhole has released more details for its upcoming governance token airdrop.\nSome holders of an eligible NFT collection were unable to qualify.\nWormhole Discord users, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers are also eligible for the airdrop.",
                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request. Disclaimer: The author of this piece is eligible to receive a W token airdrop."

                "keypoints": "Revolut has launched a new feature to let users buy and deposit crypto into their MetaMask wallets.\nThe move comes as Wall Street giants and fintech firms increasingly move into crypto.",
                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "body": " Stablecoins accounted for more than half of all daily trading volume among the most traded cryptocurrencies Monday. Tether, First Digital USD, and USDC each clocked around $58 billion, $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Collectively, these three stablecoins made up more than 60% of the trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies that day. Bitcoin reached about $34 billion, while Ethereum saw $20 billion. Stablecoins \u201chave attracted the most capital, emphasising investors\u2019 inclination towards stability and reliability over other alternatives,\u201d Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They provide an avenue for traders to park their funds during highly volatile periods. \u201cStablecoins are an extremely crucial asset for traders both from a stability perspective and a leverage perspective,\u201d Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, told DL News. Stablecoins allow traders to manage and amplify their trading positions efficiently. By using stablecoins as collateral, traders can borrow additional funds to increase their investment size, potentially magnifying their profits or losses. They\u2019re also highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into other cryptocurrencies or used for transactions. Doyle pointed to the issuance of stablecoins as a measure of new capital flowing into the cryptocurrency market, which has topped $3.5 billion this year. That represents a growth of about 5% compared to the total market value of stablecoins seen at the start of 2024. Trade activity has so far pushed the total combined stablecoin market value to its highest peak since December 20, 2022, above $140 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Growth in the creation and distribution of stablecoins \u201cindicates confidence in the segment and shows new dollars onchain,\u201d Doyle said.

                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Hector Network, the failed DeFi project once worth over $100 million, has now gone into receivership in the British Virgin Islands after its community \u201crage quit\u201d last year, dissolving the venture. That\u2019s based on a court order by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court on February 19, an announcement on the Hector Network site states. Interpath BVI has been chosen as interim receivers, according to the court order. \u201cThe Receivers have taken full custody of the treasury assets, which have been moved to a new secure wallet,\u201d James Drury, an Interpath BVI director overseeing the receivership, told DL News. As interim receivers, Interpath are now custodians of Hector DAO\u2019s remaining assets, worth $9.3 million \u2014 a far cry from the $100 million it owned during its heyday 18 months ago. On-chain data from February 19 show multiple transfers totalling $9.3 million in USDC and Ether from Hector DAO\u2019s known treasury wallet address to a new location \u2014 a Gnosis Safe wallet with a three-of-three multisig. Interpath is now waiting for the court in the British Virgin Islands to finalise its role as receiver. That\u2019s expected to happen on March 12, after which the firm said it will proceed with plans to liquidate and distribute the treasury assets to Hector Network\u2019s investors. Drury confirmed that Interpath has sole custody of Hector DAO\u2019s treasury. \u201cAll previous multi-signors have been removed from the old wallet and none are involved in the new wallet,\u201d Drury said. \u201cThe multi-signors are employees of Interpath.\u201d Multisig wallets require more than one signor to approve a transaction. Receivership is a court-mandated process aimed at asset recovery on behalf of creditors of a failed enterprise. The process nominates a receiver to liquidate the company\u2019s holdings and distribute them to creditors. Hector DAO is the community that briefly administered the Hector Network project. Hector Network investors had previously been locked out of official communication channels by the project team. Interpath said it has control of those social channels and has also provided a dedicated email address that investors can use to contact the advisory firm. Interpath\u2019s involvement as receivers of Hector Network assets is the latest salvo in the Hector Network rage quit saga. Rage quit happens in DeFi when project participants, be they investors or developers, agree to liquidate all or part of the protocol\u2019s treasury and distribute the proceeds pro-rata to token holders. Dissatisfied with over 18 months of perceived mismanagement of funds by the developers, Hector Network investors voted to dissolve the project last April. That\u2019s because the project\u2019s treasury dwindled from $100 million to $16 million, mostly via six-figure salaries awarded to team members. After a protracted struggle, the remaining members of the Hector Network team agreed to liquidate the treasury. That decision happened immediately after the project suffered $8 million in losses from last year\u2019s Multichain bridge incident. The redemption was again suspended after $2.7 million was mysteriously removed from the project\u2019s treasury. Hector Network developers have not responded to several requests for comments from DL News in the past. Interpath says it is investigating January\u2019s unauthorised withdrawal from the treasury. \u201cThe Receivers have already started looking at tracing the proceeds of that hack on the basis that the right to recover those proceeds comprises an asset of Hector DAO and therefore something that we should be taking steps to preserve.\u201d Interpath has some experience with crypto asset recovery as the firm was involved in the efforts to recover funds syphoned in the $4 million exploit of bridge protocol ChainSwap in 2021. The firm is also acting as liquidator of Three Arrows Fund Limited, the feeder fund of the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added.

USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly sucessful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer annual yields of 39%, 35%, and 24% on USDC deposits, respectively.\nUtilisation rates on USDC pools are relatively high, likely because of the demand for leverage and points farming.",
                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Wormhole has released more details for its upcoming governance token airdrop.\nSome holders of an eligible NFT collection were unable to qualify.\nWormhole Discord users, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers are also eligible for the airdrop.",
                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request.

                "keypoints": "Revolut has launched a new feature to let users buy and deposit crypto into their MetaMask wallets.\nThe move comes as Wall Street giants and fintech firms increasingly move into crypto.",
                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The top three stablecoins accounted for more than 60% of trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies on Monday.\nStablecoin issuance serves as a measure of new capital entering the market.",
                "body": " Stablecoins accounted for more than half of all daily trading volume among the most traded cryptocurrencies Monday. Tether, First Digital USD, and USDC each clocked around $58 billion, $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Collectively, these three stablecoins made up more than 60% of the trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies that day. Bitcoin reached about $34 billion, while Ethereum saw $20 billion. Stablecoins \u201chave attracted the most capital, emphasising investors\u2019 inclination towards stability and reliability over other alternatives,\u201d Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They provide an avenue for traders to park their funds during highly volatile periods. \u201cStablecoins are an extremely crucial asset for traders both from a stability perspective and a leverage perspective,\u201d Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, told DL News. Stablecoins allow traders to manage and amplify their trading positions efficiently. By using stablecoins as collateral, traders can borrow additional funds to increase their investment size, potentially magnifying their profits or losses. They\u2019re also highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into other cryptocurrencies or used for transactions. Doyle pointed to the issuance of stablecoins as a measure of new capital flowing into the cryptocurrency market, which has topped $3.5 billion this year. That represents a growth of about 5% compared to the total market value of stablecoins seen at the start of 2024. Trade activity has so far pushed the total combined stablecoin market value to its highest peak since December 20, 2022, above $140 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Growth in the creation and distribution of stablecoins \u201cindicates confidence in the segment and shows new dollars onchain,\u201d Doyle said.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly sucessful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer annual yields of 39%, 35%, and 24% on USDC deposits, respectively.\nUtilisation rates on USDC pools are relatively high, likely because of the demand for leverage and points farming.",
                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Wormhole has released more details for its upcoming governance token airdrop.\nSome holders of an eligible NFT collection were unable to qualify.\nWormhole Discord users, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers are also eligible for the airdrop.",
                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request.

                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The top three stablecoins accounted for more than 60% of trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies on Monday.\nStablecoin issuance serves as a measure of new capital entering the market.",
                "body": " Stablecoins accounted for more than half of all daily trading volume among the most traded cryptocurrencies Monday. Tether, First Digital USD, and USDC each clocked around $58 billion, $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Collectively, these three stablecoins made up more than 60% of the trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies that day. Bitcoin reached about $34 billion, while Ethereum saw $20 billion. Stablecoins \u201chave attracted the most capital, emphasising investors\u2019 inclination towards stability and reliability over other alternatives,\u201d Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They provide an avenue for traders to park their funds during highly volatile periods. \u201cStablecoins are an extremely crucial asset for traders both from a stability perspective and a leverage perspective,\u201d Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, told DL News. Stablecoins allow traders to manage and amplify their trading positions efficiently. By using stablecoins as collateral, traders can borrow additional funds to increase their investment size, potentially magnifying their profits or losses. They\u2019re also highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into other cryptocurrencies or used for transactions. Doyle pointed to the issuance of stablecoins as a measure of new capital flowing into the cryptocurrency market, which has topped $3.5 billion this year. That represents a growth of about 5% compared to the total market value of stablecoins seen at the start of 2024. Trade activity has so far pushed the total combined stablecoin market value to its highest peak since December 20, 2022, above $140 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Growth in the creation and distribution of stablecoins \u201cindicates confidence in the segment and shows new dollars onchain,\u201d Doyle said.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request.

                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "body": " Stablecoins accounted for more than half of all daily trading volume among the most traded cryptocurrencies Monday. Tether, First Digital USD, and USDC each clocked around $58 billion, $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, CoinGecko data shows. Collectively, these three stablecoins made up more than 60% of the trading volume of the five most traded cryptocurrencies that day. Bitcoin reached about $34 billion, while Ethereum saw $20 billion. Stablecoins \u201chave attracted the most capital, emphasising investors\u2019 inclination towards stability and reliability over other alternatives,\u201d Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, told DL News. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They provide an avenue for traders to park their funds during highly volatile periods. \u201cStablecoins are an extremely crucial asset for traders both from a stability perspective and a leverage perspective,\u201d Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata, told DL News. Stablecoins allow traders to manage and amplify their trading positions efficiently. By using stablecoins as collateral, traders can borrow additional funds to increase their investment size, potentially magnifying their profits or losses. They\u2019re also highly liquid, meaning they can be quickly converted into other cryptocurrencies or used for transactions. Doyle pointed to the issuance of stablecoins as a measure of new capital flowing into the cryptocurrency market, which has topped $3.5 billion this year. That represents a growth of about 5% compared to the total market value of stablecoins seen at the start of 2024. Trade activity has so far pushed the total combined stablecoin market value to its highest peak since December 20, 2022, above $140 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Growth in the creation and distribution of stablecoins \u201cindicates confidence in the segment and shows new dollars onchain,\u201d Doyle said.

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they did not support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and other stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were only feasible on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they did not lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments which will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but they are expected to arrive within the next few weeks. The hope is that these new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last 7 days, trading at $2.80, implying a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer annual yields of 39%, 35%, and 24% on USDC deposits, respectively.\nUtilisation rates on USDC pools are relatively high, likely because of the demand for leverage and points farming.",
                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Wormhole has released more details for its upcoming governance token airdrop.\nSome holders of an eligible NFT collection were unable to qualify.\nWormhole Discord users, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers are also eligible for the airdrop.",
                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request. Disclaimer: The author of this piece is eligible to receive a W token airdrop."

                "keypoints": "Revolut has launched a new feature to let users buy and deposit crypto into their MetaMask wallets.\nThe move comes as Wall Street giants and fintech firms increasingly move into crypto.",
                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request. Disclaimer: The author of this piece is eligible to receive a W token airdrop."

                "keypoints": "Revolut has launched a new feature to let users buy and deposit crypto into their MetaMask wallets.\nThe move comes as Wall Street giants and fintech firms increasingly move into crypto.",
                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Goldfinch\u2019s third default shows just how risky undercollateralised crypto lending can be",
                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer annual yields of 39%, 35%, and 24% on USDC deposits, respectively.\nUtilisation rates on USDC pools are relatively high, likely because of the demand for leverage and points farming.",
                "body": " As traders on Solana capitalise on its dramatic price increase or the meteoric rise in memecoin trading, other users are quietly earning double-digit yields from some of the blockchain\u2019s top lending platforms. Solend, marginfi, and Kamino offer users an annual percentage yield on USDC deposits of 39%, 35%, and 24%, respectively. USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is fully backed by US dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Lending protocols let users deposit assets in a liquidity pool for other users to borrow. Borrowers pay depositors a fee, which fluctuates depending on the utilisation rate. The rate is determined by how much of the assets deposited in a liquidity pool is borrowed. If 100 USDC is deposited and 90 USDC is borrowed, the utilisation rate \u2014 and ultimately the borrow rate \u2014 will be higher than if that same pool had 100 USDC deposited and 10 USDC borrowed. The utilisation rate for the USDC market on marginfi is now 86%, which is relatively high, resulting in the 35% yield it offers. Generally, lending protocols experience rising rates when demand for leverage increases. If a user wants to leverage their assets, they can take their assets like SOL, deposit them on a lending protocol and borrow an asset like a stablecoin against it. This allows the trader to maintain exposure to the deposited asset, in this case, SOL, while borrowing a stablecoin to then use elsewhere. Meanwhile, marginfi and Kamino are also running point campaigns. Points are given out by protocols to incentivize users to interact with their protocol and usually convert to a token at a later date. In the case of marginfi and Kamino, points are given to users based on the dollar value of their deposits and borrows they generate per day. The demand for leverage and points continues to have a dramatic impact on the yields offered by these protocols. Got a tip about DeFi? Reach out at ryan@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Wormhole has released more details for its upcoming governance token airdrop.\nSome holders of an eligible NFT collection were unable to qualify.\nWormhole Discord users, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers are also eligible for the airdrop.",
                "body": " Crypto bridge Wormhole just announced the eligibility criteria for its upcoming W governance token airdrop, where almost 400,000 wallets qualified. As has become more common in recent crypto airdrops, Wormhole included holders of certain NFT collections in its airdrop. Bad Kids, DeGods, Mad Lads, and y00ts, all NFT collections with ties to Wormhole, will receive tokens. But not all holders of eligible NFTs were able to qualify, leading to complaints over how Wormhole determined eligibility. 0xAllen, a pseudonymous Bad Kids NFT investor, told DL News that many Bad Kids NFT holders missed out on the airdrop, despite Wormhole including the collection. \u201cYou had to get a specific role in the Discord server and there was a small time window to obtain it,\u201d he said. DL News asked Wormhole about some Bad Kids NFT holders missing out on the airdrop. \u201cThe eligibility criteria and snapshot date are in the blog post, and yes, there are users from the various groups who will not qualify,\u201d a Wormhole spokesperson told DL News. The Bad Kids NFT collection launched in 2022 on a Cosmos-based blockchain called Stargaze, which is connected to other blockchains using Wormhole\u2019s technology. The gaff adds to a growing list of controversies surrounding crypto airdrops. In February, Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Starknet was hit by a wave of criticism over the eligibility criteria of its STRK token airdrop. Many users who registered activity on the blockchain in the leadup to the airdrop were excluded, while others, such as one user who fixed a spelling error in Starkware\u2019s documentation, received over $3,000 worth of tokens. Earlier in the year, Alt Layer, a protocol that facilitates the launch of other blockchains, also received criticism for its airdrop after a large amount of tokens were allocated to holders of OG Badge NFTs, which had been distributed to Alt Layer team members almost a year prior. Wormhole plans to distribute 500 million W tokens to users who registered onchain activity across more than 30 Wormhole-connected blockchains and applications. Among the actions granting users tokens was using Wormhole-connected protocol across 26 blockchains, including Ethereum-compatible chains like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, as well as other chains such as Solana, Aptos and Near. Using DeFi applications that integrate Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain messaging, such as Solana decentralised exchange aggregator Jupiter and USDC issuer Circle\u2019s cross-chain transfer protocol, also granted tokens. An additional 117 million tokens will go to Wormhole Discord users, various NFT communities, the Monad community, and the top 10,000 PYTH token stakers. Although the token has yet to launch, futures contracts tracking its price already trade across several exchanges. At the current futures price of $1.45 per token, the airdrop is set to give away over $900 million worth of tokens. Wormhole helps separate blockchains send information between each other. The most common application of this technology is bridging \u2014 transferring crypto assets from one blockchain to another. The W token will govern the Wormhole DAO, a digital cooperative of token holders who will eventually be responsible for various aspects of the protocol\u2019s management. The W token will launch with an initial circulating supply of 1.8 billion. Wormhole\u2019s initial airdrop will distribute 6.17% \u2014 about 617 million tokens \u2014 of its planned 10 billion token supply. The remaining 1.2 billion tokens will be distributed to those running Wormhole\u2019s infrastructure, core contributors to the protocol, strategic network participants, and the Wormhole Foundation, among others. The Wormhole Foundation is an organisation tasked with stewarding the development of the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole announced the airdrop at the beginning of February. The move came just five months after wormhole parted ways from its previous owner Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of market maker Jump Trading. Wormhole has not yet revealed when those eligible to receive W tokens will be able to claim them, nor the exact criteria it is using to allocate tokens. Only activity before a February 6 snapshot counted towards eligibility. Update, March 8: DL News was initially told a quote included in this article was provided by Wormhole Foundation co-founder and COO Dan Reecer. Wormhole has since requested the comment be attributed to a Wormhole spokesperson instead. The article has been updated to accommodate this request.

                "keypoints": "Revolut has launched a new feature to let users buy and deposit crypto into their MetaMask wallets.\nThe move comes as Wall Street giants and fintech firms increasingly move into crypto.",
                "body": " Revolut is diving deeper into crypto with a new MetaMask collaboration in a bid to give more people access to digital assets. The challenger bank unveiled a new feature on Wednesday. Dubbed Revolut Ramp, it will allow its 40 million users to buy cryptocurrencies and deposit them directly into MetaMask wallets. \u201cThis partnership is really about giving our users what they want \u2014 more control over their crypto, in a straightforward way,\u201d Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt also plays a crucial role in fostering broader crypto adoption, opening up the world of crypto to more people.\u201d MetaMask has 30 million users, the company said. The Revolut Ramp launch comes as traditional finance firms increasingly muscle into crypto. Most noticeably, Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have powered the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund boom this year, a key driver behind why the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high on Tuesday. However, smaller firms, like stock-trading app Robinhood, payments behemoth PayPal, and mobile payments firm Venmo have also grown their cryptocurrency services lately. Revolut Ramp is available through MetaMask\u2019s app, browser extension, and its Portfolio platform. Users can purchase up to 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, USDC, and Shiba Inu. Ramp is designed to skip additional verification for existing Revolut customers by leveraging know-your-customer processes already conducted via the Revolut app. New customers can still use Revolut Ramp, but must undergo the same KYC process that the neobank\u2019s users are subjected to. A \u201csmall fee\u201d for purchasing crypto with Revolut Ramp on MetaMask will apply, which will be displayed before the purchase, typical of all services through the wallet app. MetaMask and Revolut did not specify their exact fee structure and did not return requests for comment. Revolut first launched its crypto trading business across Europe in 2017. During the 2021 bull run, it contributed to its \u00a339.8 million profit. Crypto contributed \u201cup to 30%, 35% in revenues in 2021,\u201d CEO Nikolay Storonsky told Bloomberg TV in 2022. Those tailwinds ceased in 2022 when Revolut went back in the red, revealing a \u00a325.4 million loss in its 2022 financial results, published in December. Despite the headwinds and scandals like the collapse of FTX, Storonsky told fDi Intelligence in 2022 that Revolut was \u201cdoubling down on crypto products.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "DeFi exchange dYdX attracts stakers amid $41bn in trading volume",
                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Parcl, a Solana-based real estate trading platform, confirmed that user-earned points will convert to tokens in April.\nAirdrop farmers could potentially share $160 million if PRCL trades at the $2 it is currently trading at on pre-markets.\nOne strategy on Parcl lets homeowners hedge against potential declines in their property value.",
                "body": " Parcl is the latest project to confirm that the points it gives users for interacting with the protocol will convert to tokens. The conversion will take place in April. The Solana-based protocol lets users trade on the prices in certain real estate markets with up to 10-fold leverage. The platform uses its own data feed that tracks changes in the price per square foot for residential properties in select markets and feeds that data into a smart contract that allows traders to bet on the price movements in each real estate market. Traders and liquidity providers can earn points on Parcl by using the platform. Issuing points typically precedes an airdrop. The points then become tradable tokens. Since launching its V3 product in November, Parcl has facilitated over $210 million in total volume from more than 25,000 daily active users. On December 15, Parcl began its points programme, where users could earn four points per day per dollar of liquidity provided, or one point per day per dollar of open interest on the protocol. Open interest in trading refers to the dollar amount of open positions a trader is holding. As of 3 pm GMT on February 28, there was over $100 million in open interest on Parcl. At the time, it wasn\u2019t known whether these points would convert to tokens. The total value of crypto assets deposited in the protocol steadily increased from around $7,000 on December 15 at the beginning of the points program to $73 million as of February 26. When the Parcl team confirmed in a blog that earned points would be converted into tokens in April, users ploughed $25 million into the protocol overnight. Airdrop farmers \u2014 users whose trading strategy is to interact with protocols in the hopes of receiving tokens in the future \u2014 continue to have a noticeable impact on protocol metrics. Given the PRCL token is trading at $2 on pre-markets, these airdrop farmers may be set to receive $160 million if PRCL is still trading at $2 in April. Parcl depends on liquidity providers to deposit the USDC stablecoin, so that others can leverage trade, or used borrowed money to increase the size of a trade. Leverage trading on Parcl is enabled by the USDC deposits of liquidity providers. In return for providing liquidity, users are rewarded with 70% of trading fees on the protocol. With this setup, liquidity providers are essentially acting as a bank, and could lose money if traders are profitable over the long term. Traders, meanwhile, can bet on the future prices of 10 US markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Trading these markets is similar to trading a traditional futures contract; users can go long or short any of the markets with up to 10x leverage. Parcl can also be used to hedge the value of properties for homeowners, as Parcl co-founder Kellen Grenier stated in a recent interview. If someone owned a house in London, and they believed the price of their home may fall, they could short the London market on Parcl. If the value of their home decreases, they can potentially make up the difference with the profits from their short on Parcl. But, there are risks involved with this strategy. Users must pay a funding fee to liquidity providers. The fee is used to keep the number of longs and shorts in a market balanced, so that liquidity providers won\u2019t be overexposed to one side of the market. This fee can go as high as 35% per day, although the highest funding rate on Parcl now is just 0.07%. The PRCL token will go live in April and will mainly be used in the governance of the Parcl protocol. The total supply will be 1 billion PRCL, with 7%-8% earmarked for the community airdrop. At the time of the airdrop, it is estimated that 10%-12% of the total token supply will be in circulation. Users can already trade the PRCL token on Aevo, a decentralised exchange, where one PRCL token is trading for $2 \u2013 implying a fully diluted value of $2 billion. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging.

                "headline": "How Bitcoin trading frenzy almost depleted a vault in MakerDAO",
                "keypoints": "MakerDAO is mulling a proposal to shore up USDC backing for its DAI stablecoin.\nTuesday's market volatility caused a spike in demand for DAI.\nThe proposed measures, if approved, would only be temporary.",
                "body": " Bitcoin\u2019s dizzying surge to above $69,000 on Tuesday almost upended the backing for MakerDAO\u2019s $4.3 billion DAI stablecoin. That\u2019s because one of the Maker vaults containing collateral that backs DAI was minutes away from being depleted amid the frenzied market action. MakerDAO\u2019s USDC PSM was the vault in question. PSM, which stands for \u201cpeg stability module,\u201d is a tool used by the protocol to mint DAI in exchange for supported stablecoins such as USDC. In the end, MakerDAO was able to collateralise the vault adequately with a fresh supply of USDC, but the PSM reserves have diminished to less than $320 million, according to a governance post on Friday by the DAO\u2019s risk unit BA Labs. The DAO, or decentralised autonomous organisation, is now considering an accelerated proposal to make temporary changes to the protocol that will help the DeFi lender navigate periods of excessive demand for DAI, as was the case during Tuesday\u2019s market volatility. The situation is so pressing that approved changes will be ratified by an executive vote rather than by the normal multi-step governance process. DAI\u2019s total supply is down to $4.38 billion from $5 billion at the start of the week, data from Makerburn shows. That decline is due mainly to excessive DAI minting by crypto traders who were looking to place optimistic bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Bitcoin price spike caused the PSM to suffer because Maker guarantees a fixed borrowing rate,\u201d Pablo Veyrat, co-founder of stablecoin protocol Angle Protocol, told DL News. \u201cAnyone looking to long Bitcoin\u2013USD at a fixed rate over time is incentivised to do this directly with Maker,\u201d he said. The traders were borrowing DAI from MakerDAO and swapping directly to Bitcoin to profit from BTC\u2019s price climb. That depleted the PSM faster than it could be replenished. The USDC PSM isn\u2019t Maker\u2019s only USDC vault. The DeFi lender also has $1.1 billion worth of USDC in its real-world asset vaults, but those funds cannot be redeemed quickly to cover any shortfalls in the PSM reserves. A depleted USDC PSM could cause DAI to depeg from the US dollar, but Veyrat said that would be only temporary. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been bad in the sense that it would have come back to peg and all people closing their Bitcoin long would have had to rebuy DAI \u2014 by putting USDC in the PSM \u2014 and repay their debt,\u201d Veyrat said. The BA Labs proposal recommends four broad temporary changes to the Maker protocol. One is to make it more attractive to save DAI rather than to borrow it by raising the DAI savings rate, or DSR \u2014 interest paid to DAI holders who lock the stablecoin on the protocol \u2014 to 15% from the current rate of 5%. On top of the rate bump for holding DAI, the proposal also calls for an increase in the protocol\u2019s stability fees for borrowing the stablecoin against accepted collateral. Maker\u2019s stability fee is the interest rate charged for borrowing DAI. BA Labs said the measure was appropriate given that MakerDAO\u2019s borrow rate was lagging other DeFi lending rivals whose rates have surged lately. Other changes include adjusting the intervals for increasing the debt ceiling to 12 hours from 24 hours. That would allow the protocol to more rapidly accept more collateral to back the DAI. Also, BA Labs recommended a decrease in the time lag for approving governance actions after execution to 16 hours from the current 48 hours. These changes would be temporary. Should the DAO approve them, the protocol will revert to its normal settings once the crypto market volatility peters out. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte urges stablecoin users to look beyond circulation.\nCircle took a hit when Silicon Valley Bank failed.\nThe issuer is looking for an edge by embracing regulatory compliance.",
                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan.

                "headline": "Ripple to face off against Circle, PayPal with new USD stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "keypoints": "Lower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: It\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week. Cancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Among them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base. EIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet. By reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs. EIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December. The end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second. After Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones. Crypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week. The PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar. Because Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols. In response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market. According to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment. Higher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM. Jito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain. Jito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana. The move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements. Sandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins. Memecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours. Blockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. It allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place. 69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

Demand for US dollar leverage in DeFi is surging. Lending protocol Compound\u2019s $478 million USDC pool is over 99% utilized \u2014 meaning borrowers have taken out USDC loans close to the total amount available. Got a tip about DeFi?

                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "DYdX stakers are cashing in on trading fees during the crypto rally.\nDeFi exchange launched a network for traders playing BTC and ETH.\nUniswap is eyeing a similar staking model.",
                "body": " With Bitcoin hitting new highs on a weekly basis, dYdX stakers are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in trading fees. Stakers on the decentralised perpetual exchange earned an aggregate of $460,000 on March 5, the first time Bitcoin broke past its previous record high of $69,000. In the last 30 days, all dYdX stakers have earned a total of $5 million, according to data from Mintscan. The fees were paid out in USDC, Circle\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Tristan Dickinson, a dYdX Foundation spokesman, told DL News that the project hosted $41 billion in trading volume across the dYdX chain and dYdX v3 in the past three weeks. During that same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared 51% and 60%, respectively. And with crypto markets showing no signs of slowing down, these fees for stakers are expected to keep growing. DYdX typically handles around $1 billion in trading volume daily across 54 different trading pairs, according to CoinGecko. Due to the design of dYdX\u2019s new bespoke blockchain network, 100% of protocol fees from the dYdX chain go to dYdX chain stakers, Dickinson said. Launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, dYdX rapidly grew in popularity but eventually ran into the network\u2019s limitations. Trading cryptocurrencies on Ethereum is often too expensive and slow to compete with centralised exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To meet demand, dYdX launched an independent chain in November using tools from another blockchain network called Cosmos. Now, dYdX has native staking and its own group of validators \u2014 the machines that help verify crypto transactions. Users can stake the network\u2019s native dYdX token with any validator. The project is maintained by four entities: the dYdX Foundation, dYdX Trading Inc., the dYdX grants subDAO, and the dYdX operations subDAO. A DAO, or a decentralised autonomous organisation, is an online group of token holders that can vote and make proposals to change a crypto protocol or approve grants. With trading fees now distributed entirely to stakers, these four entities are funded by making proposals to their community and then, if those proposals pass, drawing from the community treasury. Dickinson explained that the $230 million treasury was accumulated with fees from previous versions of dYdX. The dYdX community approved a $30 million grant to the foundation in February. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into this area model where eventually it\u2019s going to be completely community-controlled and governed, and the funding comes from the treasury,\u201d Dickinson said. Another decentralised exchange mulling a similar model is Uniswap. Calling its version of the model the \u201cfee switch,\u201d the Uniswap community has waffled over whether holders of its native UNI token should also be allowed a slice of the platform\u2019s trading fees. The initial temperature check proposal passed nearly unanimously last week, moving it to the next stage of the governance process. Temperature checks are Uniswap\u2019s first step in weighing community sentiment before making any sweeping changes. With daily trading volumes over $3 billion and nearly $1.5 billion in accrued fees, flipping that switch would undoubtedly benefit UNI token holders.

                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "headline": "Circle, Ripple and other crypto giants came to Paris for \u2018regulatory clarity\u2019 and returned with reality check",
                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "headline": "ONDO soars 140% as tokenisation boom trumps Fed risk \u2014 for now",
                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock announced its first tokenised fund on Ethereum last week.\nBernstein says the asset managers decision to use Ethereum lends legitimacy to the smart contract blockchain.\nThe fund acts as the first major test case for institutional investors experiencing 24/7 instant settlement.",
                "body": " On the heels of BlackRock\u2019s wildly successful foray into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced a tokenised fund on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock\u2019s decision to offer investors a tokenised money market fund on Ethereum is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades,\u201d say Bernstein analysts. Here\u2019s why: The BlackRock US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity fund, dubbed BUIDL, is not the first attempt at tokenising a money market fund, but it will likely be the biggest. Franklin Templeton launched its own fund on chain in April 2023. BlackRock manages around $9 trillion more than Templeton. The launch of BlackRock\u2019s fund is significant because it brings together firms from both the traditional world, including BNY Mellon, and the crypto world, including Coinbase and Fireblocks. \u201cThis would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock\u2019s first foray into tokenised funds is a major test case for institutional investors to experience instant settlement, Bernstein analysts said. BlackRock\u2019s fund will \u201cact as the first major test-case for institutional holders to experience 24/7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201d Bernstein said. BlackRock stands out from firms like JPMorgan \u2014 which opted for its own private chain known as Onyx. The choice of Ethereum as the public blockchain vs. choosing a private blockchain \u201callows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cTokenised fund redemption could be on-chain with stablecoins, e.g USDC, integration.\u201d New asset-classes including bonds could lead to interoperability between asset-classes on-chain. The fund giant\u2019s decision to use a public blockchain \u201cbrings legitimacy to public smart contract chains such as Ethereum, so far only seen as retail casinos,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201d BUIDL will invest in US Treasury bills, cash, and repurchase agreements and offers a stable value of $1 per token. Yields will be paid out daily to investors who can invest through Securitize Markets. \u201cOn-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cCrypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via ETF products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics.\u201d \u201cAsset managers could see this as a commercial revenue and cost saving opportunity, and not just monetary revolution via non-sovereign money.\u201d"

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. With $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender, Circle\u2019s stablecoin, USDC, briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Tokenisation hype has helped send Ondo Finance's token to an all-time high.\nBut Fed rate cuts could impact demand for the protocol's tokenised US Treasuries.\nOndo says its Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones.",
                "body": " Investors just pushed real world asset protocol Ondo Finance\u2019s ONDO token to a new all-time high. But forecasted rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve could cut the party short. ONDO soared 140% last week to an all-time high of $0.97. At current prices, Ondo Finance commands a fully-diluted market value of over $9 billion. Ondo Finance makes revenue by offering DeFi users the ability to invest in tokenised versions of US Treasuries. If the Fed lowers interest rates, the yield on Ondo\u2019s US Treasury-backed products will drop, making them less appealing to investors. \u201cModerately lower rates may impact Ondo\u2019s growth but only slightly at most,\u201d Justin Schmidt, chief operating officer at Ondo Finance, told DL News. The spike in ONDO\u2019s price comes days after asset manager BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to create the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with asset tokenisation firm Securitize. Securitize\u2019s presence means the fund has something to do with the tokenisation of real-world assets \u2014 like the products Ondo offers. Bernstein analysts said the fund is \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d Last year, protocols like Ondo soared in popularity as the Fed raised interest rates to 5.25% to 5.5% \u2014 their highest level in more than 20 years. DeFi users piled into Ondo to take advantage of the high yields offered on US Treasuries, pushing its TVL \u2014 the total value of user deposits on the protocol \u2014 to over $200 million. But with rate cuts on the horizon and higher stablecoin yields in DeFi, the appetite for tokenised Treasuries could cool substantially. At the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 21, Fed Chair Jerome Powell again signalled that he will lower rates to 4.5% to 4.75% by the end of the year. According to Guy Young, founder of stablecoin protocol Ethena, a fall in interest rates could impact demand for such tokenised Treasuries. Ethena offers USDe \u2014 a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that earns yield from a combination of Ethereum staking yields and derivatives positions. \u201cLower risk-free rates will significantly impact the demand for real-world asset related products,\u201d Young told DL News. Ondo Finance offers other real-world asset products in addition to its tokenised Treasuries. But with its US Treasury-backed products making up the vast majority of the protocol\u2019s deposits, a decline in demand will likely impact the protocol. Schmidt said that even if interest rates fall to 4.5%, it\u2019s still \u201clikely prudent\u201d for investors to put their money in US Treasuries instead of bank accounts to stay safe from the risk of a bank insolvency. But in DeFi, investors have access to higher \u2014 and riskier \u2014 yields on dollar-backed assets. The sector has already experienced a 25% loss in market share versus stablecoins since October last year when crypto yields began to exceed Treasury rates by a wide margin, Young said. Aave, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum with over $11.6 billion of deposits, is one example of such crypto yields. It offers over 11% APY on Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin. Aave\u2019s rates fluctuate based on borrowing demand. The high yield indicates a high demand for borrowing USDC. In comparison, Ondo\u2019s Short-Term US Government Treasuries product offers a 5% annual return on USDC. Instead of trying to grow its tokenised Treasuries, it may be that Ondo focuses more on its other products \u2014 at least for the time being. \u201cOndo\u2019s Global Markets business focuses broadly on tokenisation of many public securities, not just interest-rate sensitive ones,\u201d Schmidt said. Ondo Global Markets aims to provide access to traditional securities \u2014 like shares in companies like Amazon or Google \u2014 for onchain investors and protocol developers. Compared to other traditional brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, and Apex Clearing, Ondo Global Markets is the only platform with smart contract compatibility and distribution and settlement of assets happening on the same rails as crypto assets. \u201cWe have a large addressable market for the foreseeable future,\u201d Schmidt said.

                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "headline": "Circle\u2019s $2.4bn dominance on Solana shows stablecoin bet is paying off",
                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Crypto custodian Anchorage Digital has introduced support for Arbitrum, the largest layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Backed by Visa and Goldman Sachs, Anchorage serves institutional clients such as venture capital firms and asset managers. Its support for Arbitrum includes custody of Arbitrum-based Ether, USDC, and ARB, as well as forthcoming \u201cgovernance support.\u201d Anchorage is one of several crypto custodians that hold Arbitrum-based tokens, according to Steven Goldfeder, one of the blockchain\u2019s co-founders. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have the core group of crypto-versed people that always figure things out, but that\u2019s not where our vision ends,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOur vision ends at the masses generally, and having a variety of [custodians] that work for retail and institutional, I think, are very important.\u201d Institutional interest in crypto has surged this year, with the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s launch of BUIDL, a tokenised money market fund. Ethereum developers are betting that the most practical road to mass adoption runs through layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum. Ethereum is often congested and expensive \u2014 the cost of running a truly decentralised network, according to proponents. Cheaper and faster layer 2 blockchains are something of a workaround, processing and batching transactions before appending them to Ethereum. They now handle almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself. Arbitrum accounts for more than 43% of crypto on all layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT. Its $3.1 billion DeFi ecosystem is more than twice the size of its next-largest competitor, Blast, according to data from DefiLlama. Last year, Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs announced it would cede control of the blockchain to its \u201ccommunity\u201d by sending its developers, investors, and longtime users newly-issued tokens called ARB, which function much like shares in a traditional company. Those people \u2014 and anyone who buys ARB on secondary markets \u2014 now control the Arbitrum DAO, a digital cooperative with the sole ability to make changes to the protocol. Anchorage will soon offer support to clients that want to participate in Arbitrum governance. CEO and co-founder Nathan McCauley declined to provide an exact date for the rollout, but said it is part of a growing trend. \u201cToday, many institutions are interested in accessing leading layer 2s like Arbitrum,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. Crypto-native companies such as crypto VCs are the most likely to take an interest in crypto governance, according to McCauley. But it\u2019s just a smaller part of a broader institutional push into the asset class. \u201cInstitutions are increasingly interested in more active participation in the full range of blockchain activity\u2014from staking to on-chain governance and voting,\u201d he told DL News through a spokesperson. \u201cWe are also seeing rising demand from registered investment advisors (RIAs), who increasingly want to offer regulated crypto to their end clients.\u201d Aleks gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Manta Pacific saw a 52% drop in crypto asset deposits in seven days after enabling STONE and wUSDM withdrawals.\nUsers faced a dilemma between waiting for the official bridge to enable withdrawals or sell depegged assets at a loss to pursue other investments.\nDespite recent challenges, Manta Network plans to introduce new technical developments and campaigns to attract capital back.",
                "body": " In the last seven days, the total value of crypto assets deposited on Manta Pacific, a modular Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has fallen by 52%. The decline occurred in the wake of the official Manta bridge enabling withdrawals of STONE and wUSDM from the blockchain on March 26. Just one day prior, on March 25, the blockchain\u2019s total crypto assets deposited stood at $497 million, but that number has since dropped to $245 million. STONE represents a liquid staked version of Ethereum, positioning it alongside competitors like stETH or rETH, while wUSDM is a wrapped variant of USDM, a stablecoin offering yields derived from Treasury bills. Kenny Li, a co-founder of Manta Network, told DL News that the significant outflow following the conclusion of its New Paradigm campaign was anticipated. He attributed the exodus to users seeking short-term gains similar to those promised by the campaign\u2019s airdrops. The campaign, which began on December 14, incentivised users with NFTs that were later converted to tokens. The NFTs were awarded for bridging assets like STONE and wUSDM onto the blockchain. However, this was a one-way bridge, meaning users had to wait until the campaign\u2019s conclusion on March 26 to withdraw their assets. Despite this, third-party bridges such as Rhino.fi facilitated user exits from the blockchain, though they didn\u2019t support transfers of STONE and wUSDM. Without the ability to withdraw STONE or wUSDM directly from Manta Pacific, users resorted to exchanging these tokens for Ether and stablecoins, such as USDC, which could then be withdrawn through the third-party bridges like Rhino.fi. This led to a considerable strain on the value of STONE and wUSDM within Manta\u2019s decentralised exchanges, causing their market value to deviate significantly from their supposed pegs. Stone Depeg The exchange rate for the wETH/STONE market on Quickswap Ultimately, the depegs for STONE and wUSDM created a situation where users were stuck with either a loss on the USD value of their deposits to chase investments elsewhere, like memecoins, or a wait for the bridge to open. Many users decided to wait for the official bridge, as shown by the over $200 million in assets leaving the blockchain within the last week. Despite the depegging on Manta, these tokens remained backed by their respective assets. For instance, each STONE token was always supported by an equivalent value in Ether, but the challenge was that redemptions were feasible only on the Ethereum mainnet. As long as users waited for the official bridge, they didn\u2019t lose any value. Manta has plans to attract this capital back. In addition to the ongoing Renew Paradigm and Restaking Paradigm campaigns, Li said his team has plans to introduce new technical developments that will bring new use cases to the industry. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what these use cases may look like, but he said they are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. The hope is that the new use cases will reignite interest in the layer 2 blockchain. Manta\u2019s governance token, MANTA, is down 12% in the last seven days, trading at $2.80, which implies a $2.8 billion fully diluted value. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "How EU\u2019s \u2018complete mess\u2019 on stablecoin regulation risks delistings with MiCA deadline approaching",
                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

                "body": " Payments giant Stripe announced Thursday that it would be resuming crypto payments in 2024. \u201cAfter nearly ten years, accepting crypto is back on Stripe, coming this summer,\u201d Jeff Weinstein, product lead at Stripe, said on X. The company began its foray into crypto in 2014, though it pulled away in 2018, citing the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s network and the blockchain\u2019s consistent technological upgrades. \u201cBitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,\u201d the company wrote in a 2018 blog post. Stripe\u2019s new crypto policy favours Circle\u2019s stablecoin over Bitcoin. Users will be able to make and accept payments in USDC, through the Ethereum or Solana blockchains, according to the company\u2019s presentation. They will also be able to connect various wallets \u2014 MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow \u2014 to their Stripe accounts. \u201cTransaction settlements are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for length,\u201d Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said on Thursday. \u201cAnd transaction costs are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for budget.\u201d Stripe was also a brief supporter of Meta\u2019s stablecoin project, Libra, in 2019. Then, in 2022, it announced a payouts programme in conjunction with X, formerly Twitter, enabling creators on the platform to receive earnings in USDC. The payments services company was valued at $50 billion during a $7 billion funding round in 2023.

                "headline": "Fjord Foundry raises $15m for its FJO token, unlocking access to over $28m in platform fees",
                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "headline": "Circle, Ripple and other crypto giants came to Paris for \u2018regulatory clarity\u2019 and returned with reality check",
                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Forget USDT \u2014 Tether just reaped $4.5bn profit largely from its vast US Treasuries portfolio",
                "keypoints": "Stablecoin leader is starting to look like an investment fund thanks to its reserves.\nCEO Paolo Ardoino is keen on shedding Tether's controversial past.\nTether hits a bullish note in a market racked with uncertainty.",
                "body": " For years, crypto sceptics questioned whether Tether truly had the dollar reserves to support its world-beating stablecoin USDT, which is now worth $109 billion. Now Tether reports it\u2019s reaping so much profit from its reserves that it\u2019s starting to resemble an investment fund as much as a stablecoin issuer. In the first quarter, Tether reported it earned $4.5 billion in profit from its holdings of US Treasury bonds, gold, Bitcoin, and other assets, a 61% jump from the fourth quarter. \u201cWe need to have the vast majority of holdings in something that we can redeem for dollars right at any point in time,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CEO, told DL News in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we have Bitcoin and gold. Both are liquid, and we can sell for dollars.\u201d The news comes as the crypto market experiences a funky stretch of uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve poised to release its latest rate policy stance on Wednesday, Bitcoin has dropped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Tether\u2019s good fortune stems from its $91 billion horde of US government debt, according to a report called an \u201cattestation\u201d it released Wednesday. The fixed income instruments are widely considered to be one of the safest assets in the world due to the remote possibility Washington will ever default. After years of near-zero interest rates, Treasuries have become a boon for fixed income investors as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to dampen inflation that soared after the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is running at around 4.7%. Tether also holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.6 billion in gold, according to the attestation prepared by accounting firm BDO. In the last year, Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT, has increased its ubiquity as the top means for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrencies. It has also left behind its closest rival, USDC, which is issued by Circle. USDT is worth more than three times USDC. The value of its assets in the first quarter exceeded the value of the liabilities, namely the USDT tokens it issued, by more than $6.2 billion, the company said. Still, Tether has been dogged by reports that organised criminal groups and other bad actors use USDT to launder dirty money. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. In April, news broke that Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant, PDVSA, was tapping USDT to evade sanctions imposed by the US to punish the South American nation for pursuing anti-democratic policies. Ardoino vowed to make sure Tether does everything it can to stop sanctioned entities and criminals from using its platform and stablecoin. In recent months, the company has cooperated with US law enforcement officials on money laundering cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWe are not the police.\u201d The CEO also told DL News that the firm is trying to persuade a Big Four accounting firm \u2014 KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or PwC \u2014 to take it on as an auditing client. They have declined to do so, Ardoino said, because of \u201creputational risk.\u201d But Tether is growing. It employs around 80 people and expects to add another 50 this year, the Ardoino said.

                "headline": "How EU\u2019s \u2018complete mess\u2019 on stablecoin regulation risks delistings with MiCA deadline approaching",
                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stripe users will be able to make and receive USDC transactions through Ethereum and Solana.\nThe company had previously discontinued its Bitcoin services in 2018.",
                "body": " Payments giant Stripe announced Thursday that it would be resuming crypto payments in 2024. \u201cAfter nearly ten years, accepting crypto is back on Stripe, coming this summer,\u201d Jeff Weinstein, product lead at Stripe, said on X. The company began its foray into crypto in 2014, though it pulled away in 2018, citing the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s network and the blockchain\u2019s consistent technological upgrades. \u201cBitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,\u201d the company wrote in a 2018 blog post. Stripe\u2019s new crypto policy favours Circle\u2019s stablecoin over Bitcoin. Users will be able to make and accept payments in USDC, through the Ethereum or Solana blockchains, according to the company\u2019s presentation. They will also be able to connect various wallets \u2014 MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow \u2014 to their Stripe accounts. \u201cTransaction settlements are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for length,\u201d Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said on Thursday. \u201cAnd transaction costs are no longer comparable with Christopher Nolan films for budget.\u201d Stripe was also a brief supporter of Meta\u2019s stablecoin project, Libra, in 2019. Then, in 2022, it announced a payouts programme in conjunction with X, formerly Twitter, enabling creators on the platform to receive earnings in USDC. The payments services company was valued at $50 billion during a $7 billion funding round in 2023.

                "headline": "Fjord Foundry raises $15m for its FJO token, unlocking access to over $28m in platform fees",
                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "headline": "Circle, Ripple and other crypto giants came to Paris for \u2018regulatory clarity\u2019 and returned with reality check",
                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Forget USDT \u2014 Tether just reaped $4.5bn profit largely from its vast US Treasuries portfolio",
                "keypoints": "Stablecoin leader is starting to look like an investment fund thanks to its reserves.\nCEO Paolo Ardoino is keen on shedding Tether's controversial past.\nTether hits a bullish note in a market racked with uncertainty.",
                "body": " For years, crypto sceptics questioned whether Tether truly had the dollar reserves to support its world-beating stablecoin USDT, which is now worth $109 billion. Now Tether reports it\u2019s reaping so much profit from its reserves that it\u2019s starting to resemble an investment fund as much as a stablecoin issuer. In the first quarter, Tether reported it earned $4.5 billion in profit from its holdings of US Treasury bonds, gold, Bitcoin, and other assets, a 61% jump from the fourth quarter. \u201cWe need to have the vast majority of holdings in something that we can redeem for dollars right at any point in time,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CEO, told DL News in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we have Bitcoin and gold. Both are liquid, and we can sell for dollars.\u201d The news comes as the crypto market experiences a funky stretch of uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve poised to release its latest rate policy stance on Wednesday, Bitcoin has dropped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Tether\u2019s good fortune stems from its $91 billion horde of US government debt, according to a report called an \u201cattestation\u201d it released Wednesday. The fixed income instruments are widely considered to be one of the safest assets in the world due to the remote possibility Washington will ever default. After years of near-zero interest rates, Treasuries have become a boon for fixed income investors as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to dampen inflation that soared after the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is running at around 4.7%. Tether also holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.6 billion in gold, according to the attestation prepared by accounting firm BDO. In the last year, Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT, has increased its ubiquity as the top means for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrencies. It has also left behind its closest rival, USDC, which is issued by Circle. USDT is worth more than three times USDC. The value of its assets in the first quarter exceeded the value of the liabilities, namely the USDT tokens it issued, by more than $6.2 billion, the company said. Still, Tether has been dogged by reports that organised criminal groups and other bad actors use USDT to launder dirty money. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. In April, news broke that Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant, PDVSA, was tapping USDT to evade sanctions imposed by the US to punish the South American nation for pursuing anti-democratic policies. Ardoino vowed to make sure Tether does everything it can to stop sanctioned entities and criminals from using its platform and stablecoin. In recent months, the company has cooperated with US law enforcement officials on money laundering cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWe are not the police.\u201d The CEO also told DL News that the firm is trying to persuade a Big Four accounting firm \u2014 KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or PwC \u2014 to take it on as an auditing client. They have declined to do so, Ardoino said, because of \u201creputational risk.\u201d But Tether is growing. It employs around 80 people and expects to add another 50 this year, the Ardoino said.

                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "keypoints": "BlackRock launched the fund a month ago.\nOne firm owns a third of the fund's tokens, commanding about a third of the volume.",
                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " For years, crypto sceptics questioned whether Tether truly had the dollar reserves to support its world-beating stablecoin USDT, which is now worth $109 billion. Now Tether reports it\u2019s reaping so much profit from its reserves that it\u2019s starting to resemble an investment fund as much as a stablecoin issuer. In the first quarter, Tether reported it earned $4.5 billion in profit from its holdings of US Treasury bonds, gold, Bitcoin, and other assets, a 61% jump from the fourth quarter. \u201cWe need to have the vast majority of holdings in something that we can redeem for dollars right at any point in time,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CEO, told DL News in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we have Bitcoin and gold. Both are liquid, and we can sell for dollars.\u201d The news comes as the crypto market experiences a funky stretch of uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve poised to release its latest rate policy stance on Wednesday, Bitcoin has dropped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Tether\u2019s good fortune stems from its $91 billion horde of US government debt, according to a report called an \u201cattestation\u201d it released Wednesday. The fixed income instruments are widely considered to be one of the safest assets in the world due to the remote possibility Washington will ever default. After years of near-zero interest rates, Treasuries have become a boon for fixed income investors as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to dampen inflation that soared after the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is running at around 4.7%. Tether also holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.6 billion in gold, according to the attestation prepared by accounting firm BDO. In the last year, Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT, has increased its ubiquity as the top means for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrencies. It has also left behind its closest rival, USDC, which is issued by Circle. USDT is worth more than three times USDC. The value of its assets in the first quarter exceeded the value of the liabilities, namely the USDT tokens it issued, by more than $6.2 billion, the company said. Still, Tether has been dogged by reports that organised criminal groups and other bad actors use USDT to launder dirty money. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. In April, news broke that Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant, PDVSA, was tapping USDT to evade sanctions imposed by the US to punish the South American nation for pursuing anti-democratic policies. Ardoino vowed to make sure Tether does everything it can to stop sanctioned entities and criminals from using its platform and stablecoin. In recent months, the company has cooperated with US law enforcement officials on money laundering cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWe are not the police.\u201d The CEO also told DL News that the firm is trying to persuade a Big Four accounting firm \u2014 KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or PwC \u2014 to take it on as an auditing client. They have declined to do so, Ardoino said, because of \u201creputational risk.\u201d But Tether is growing. It employs around 80 people and expects to add another 50 this year, the Ardoino said.

                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

The company began its foray into crypto in 2014, though it pulled away in 2018, citing the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s network and the blockchain\u2019s consistent technological upgrades. \u201cBitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,\u201d the company wrote in a 2018 blog post.

                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "headline": "Circle, Ripple and other crypto giants came to Paris for \u2018regulatory clarity\u2019 and returned with reality check",
                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire.

Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Forget USDT \u2014 Tether just reaped $4.5bn profit largely from its vast US Treasuries portfolio",
                "keypoints": "Stablecoin leader is starting to look like an investment fund thanks to its reserves.\nCEO Paolo Ardoino is keen on shedding Tether's controversial past.\nTether hits a bullish note in a market racked with uncertainty.",
                "body": " For years, crypto sceptics questioned whether Tether truly had the dollar reserves to support its world-beating stablecoin USDT, which is now worth $109 billion. Now Tether reports it\u2019s reaping so much profit from its reserves that it\u2019s starting to resemble an investment fund as much as a stablecoin issuer. In the first quarter, Tether reported it earned $4.5 billion in profit from its holdings of US Treasury bonds, gold, Bitcoin, and other assets, a 61% jump from the fourth quarter. \u201cWe need to have the vast majority of holdings in something that we can redeem for dollars right at any point in time,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CEO, told DL News in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we have Bitcoin and gold. Both are liquid, and we can sell for dollars.\u201d The news comes as the crypto market experiences a funky stretch of uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve poised to release its latest rate policy stance on Wednesday, Bitcoin has dropped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Tether\u2019s good fortune stems from its $91 billion horde of US government debt, according to a report called an \u201cattestation\u201d it released Wednesday. The fixed income instruments are widely considered to be one of the safest assets in the world due to the remote possibility Washington will ever default. After years of near-zero interest rates, Treasuries have become a boon for fixed income investors as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to dampen inflation that soared after the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is running at around 4.7%. Tether also holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.6 billion in gold, according to the attestation prepared by accounting firm BDO. In the last year, Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT, has increased its ubiquity as the top means for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrencies. It has also left behind its closest rival, USDC, which is issued by Circle. USDT is worth more than three times USDC. The value of its assets in the first quarter exceeded the value of the liabilities, namely the USDT tokens it issued, by more than $6.2 billion, the company said. Still, Tether has been dogged by reports that organised criminal groups and other bad actors use USDT to launder dirty money. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. In April, news broke that Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant, PDVSA, was tapping USDT to evade sanctions imposed by the US to punish the South American nation for pursuing anti-democratic policies. Ardoino vowed to make sure Tether does everything it can to stop sanctioned entities and criminals from using its platform and stablecoin. In recent months, the company has cooperated with US law enforcement officials on money laundering cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWe are not the police.\u201d The CEO also told DL News that the firm is trying to persuade a Big Four accounting firm \u2014 KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or PwC \u2014 to take it on as an auditing client. They have declined to do so, Ardoino said, because of \u201creputational risk.\u201d But Tether is growing. It employs around 80 people and expects to add another 50 this year, the Ardoino said.

                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse of Ripple (left) makes a point at Paris Blockchain Week 2024, | copyright: Robert Tjalondo | www.rockinpictures.com | chainofevents On Wednesday, news broke that the SEC notified Uniswap, a decentralised exchange, it was probably going to be sued for violating US securities laws. Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Undercollateralised crypto lending platform Goldfinch just suffered its third default.\nThose burnt by the loss are calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury.\nCritics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans.",
                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Franklin Templeton, a $1.5 trillion asset manager, pointed to \u201cstrong support\u201d from Coinbase as a major positive for Base. Base\u2019s recent growth has been propelled by memecoin trading and interest in so-called SocialFi projects, Franklin Templeton said. \u201cIn recent months, Base has seen a significant rise in activity, primarily driven by Base meme coins trading activity and SocialFi applications such as friend.tech,\u201d the firm\u2019s note stated. Base\u2019s buzzing activity levels have prompted an increase in transaction fees for Sequencer \u2015 the part of Base\u2019s network responsible for organising, verifying, and transferring transaction bundles to the Ethereum network. Like other Ethereum layer 2 networks, Base hasn\u2019t \u201cdecentralised\u201d its Sequencer yet. All of its revenue now goes to Coinbase, the entity responsible for running the Sequencer. The bulk of the spike in activity on Base came in March when memecoin trading reached a fever pitch. Some popular tokens included TOSHI and BRETT, with BRETT reaching a peak of $800 million in market value. The memecoin trading came in the aftermath of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade that lowered transaction fees on layer 2 networks by as much as 98%. Franklin Templeton\u2019s report also said that \u201cBase has hit a home run\u201d in the SocialFi niche. \u201cCurrently, Base has [about] 46% for all transactions related to SocialFi,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis category is a key vertical for Base adoption and growth.\u201d Before memecoins exploded on Base this year, friend.tech, a popular SocialFi project, was the major draw in 2023 for activity on the network. Base\u2019s growing user adoption has also meant a big increase in stablecoin volume on the network. The market cap for stablecoins on Base has reached $2.8 billion, according to DefiLlama. Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin accounts for the bulk of the volume. That\u2019s not common in DeFi where Tether\u2019s USDT is the dominant stablecoin on most blockchains. Coinbase\u2019s support for free USDC transfers to the Base chain via the exchange\u2019s wallet since December 2023 is a likely reason for the stablecoin\u2019s popularity on the network.

                "body": " For years, crypto sceptics questioned whether Tether truly had the dollar reserves to support its world-beating stablecoin USDT, which is now worth $109 billion. Now Tether reports it\u2019s reaping so much profit from its reserves that it\u2019s starting to resemble an investment fund as much as a stablecoin issuer. In the first quarter, Tether reported it earned $4.5 billion in profit from its holdings of US Treasury bonds, gold, Bitcoin, and other assets, a 61% jump from the fourth quarter. \u201cWe need to have the vast majority of holdings in something that we can redeem for dollars right at any point in time,\u201d Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CEO, told DL News in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s also why we have Bitcoin and gold. Both are liquid, and we can sell for dollars.\u201d The news comes as the crypto market experiences a funky stretch of uncertainty. With the Federal Reserve poised to release its latest rate policy stance on Wednesday, Bitcoin has dropped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Tether\u2019s good fortune stems from its $91 billion horde of US government debt, according to a report called an \u201cattestation\u201d it released Wednesday. The fixed income instruments are widely considered to be one of the safest assets in the world due to the remote possibility Washington will ever default. After years of near-zero interest rates, Treasuries have become a boon for fixed income investors as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to dampen inflation that soared after the Covid-19 pandemic. The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is running at around 4.7%. Tether also holds $5.4 billion worth of Bitcoin and $3.6 billion in gold, according to the attestation prepared by accounting firm BDO. In the last year, Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT, has increased its ubiquity as the top means for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrencies. It has also left behind its closest rival, USDC, which is issued by Circle. USDT is worth more than three times USDC. The value of its assets in the first quarter exceeded the value of the liabilities, namely the USDT tokens it issued, by more than $6.2 billion, the company said. Still, Tether has been dogged by reports that organised criminal groups and other bad actors use USDT to launder dirty money. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. In April, news broke that Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant, PDVSA, was tapping USDT to evade sanctions imposed by the US to punish the South American nation for pursuing anti-democratic policies. Ardoino vowed to make sure Tether does everything it can to stop sanctioned entities and criminals from using its platform and stablecoin. In recent months, the company has cooperated with US law enforcement officials on money laundering cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWe are not the police.\u201d The CEO also told DL News that the firm is trying to persuade a Big Four accounting firm \u2014 KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or PwC \u2014 to take it on as an auditing client. They have declined to do so, Ardoino said, because of \u201creputational risk.\u201d But Tether is growing. It employs around 80 people and expects to add another 50 this year, the Ardoino said.

                "headline": "How EU\u2019s \u2018complete mess\u2019 on stablecoin regulation risks delistings with MiCA deadline approaching",
                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

The company began its foray into crypto in 2014, though it pulled away in 2018, citing the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s network and the blockchain\u2019s consistent technological upgrades. \u201cBitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,\u201d the company wrote in a 2018 blog post.

                "keypoints": "Fjord Foundry raised over $15.3 million for its native token FJO, bringing the total raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million.\nFjord has generated over $28 million in fees to date.\nSome 90% of the fees generated in the future will be used to buy back and burn the FJO token.",
                "body": " DeFi platform Fjord Foundry conducted its largest-ever token sale on April 19, raising $15.3 million through the sale of its own token, FJO. The sale brought the total funds raised through Fjord Foundry to over $980 million. Fjord Foundry lets projects raise funds from users through \u201cliquidity bootstrapping pools,\u201d or LBPs. LBPs enable early-stage projects to raise funds while giving users the opportunity to invest at the ground level. Since Fjord launched in November, it has generated over $28 million in fees, all of which went back to the Fjord team to further develop the project. Now, with the launch of the FJO token, 90% of the fees generated by Fjord products will benefit FJO tokenholders, as those funds will be used to buy back and burn FJO tokens. Total fees generated by Fjord Foundry V2 (Dune: gooddata_badguy) Users are charged a 2% swap fee for transactions on Fjord, and LBP pool creators are charged a 3% fee on the total raised funds. The five most recent LBPs, conducted between April 10 and April 18, generated $937,000 in fees. Under the new FJO tokenomics, this would have resulted in $843,000 used to buy FJO on the market. Additionally, once FJO token staking becomes available, expected in June, the allocation will be divided between buybacks and burns and staking rewards in the form of FJO. Burning a token in crypto means to permanently remove the token from the supply. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are token sales that distribute new tokens through a mechanism that resembles a declining price auction, similar to a Dutch auction. In LBPs, which typically last a few days, the token prices start high and can decrease over time, allowing participants to purchase at any stage during the auction. The setup differs from Dutch auctions, in that participant activity, such as purchasing tokens, can temporarily influence the price upward if demand increases. General stats for the recent FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool (Fjord Foundry) A key aspect of LBPs is the concept of \u201cweights,\u201d which are ratios determining the proportion of the new token relative to a stable asset like USDC within the pool. Initially, the weight heavily favours the new token but shifts over time toward the stable asset, facilitating a gradual reduction in the token\u2019s price. The strategy behind LBPs aims to mitigate the influence of large buyers and provide a more accessible entry point for a broader range of participants. Any project can implement LBPs with specific rules and initial conditions intended to manage the sale process, influence participant behaviour, and potentially lead to a more distributed token ownership. For example, users who participated in the FJO liquidity bootstrapping pool received an average price anywhere between $2.36 and $5.99 depending on when they purchased the token. FJO is trading at $2.25, resulting in a market capitalization of $20 million. The total supply of FJO is 100 million, which is allocated to various entities under different terms. About 10% of the total supply is in circulation. Seven different LBPs are live now, with another four expected to go live by Friday. Still, participating in an LBP on Fjord Foundry carries risks, as with any token purchase. Although the platform offers a transparent and decentralised way to offer a sale of new tokens, it doesn\u2019t control how projects use the liquidity gained from the LBP.

                "body": " After a flying start, inflows into BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum-based tokenised fund are leveling out. BUIDL began with $100 million in funding, and attracted another $160 million in the week after its March 20 launch. That leap was largely accounted for by buy-in from tokenisation firm Ondo Finance, which told CoinDesk in March it was moving $95 million of assets to the fund to settle its own Treasury-backed token. Ondo said in a blog post it was using BUIDL to speed settlement times for its customers. Since Ondo\u2019s investment, BUIDL\u2019s growth has eased, with the fund at $297 million in assets under management on Thursday. Onchain analysis shows that only 11 wallets have acquired tokens from the fund. About 90% of the supply is concentrated among five of them. Apart from the wallet that belongs to Ondo, three exhibit similar transaction activity, which suggests they may belong to the same entity. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Asked if growth appeared somewhat slow and concentrated, Securitize founder Carlos Domingo told DL News, \u201cIn a few weeks, BUIDL has become the fastest-growing tokenised fund in history.\u201d Securitize Markets worked with BlackRock to act as the platform and placement agent for BUIDL. Ondo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. BUIDL, or the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, holds a mix of cash, short-term debt agreements, and US Treasury bonds. A tokenised fund is a fund whose shares, or units, trade on a blockchain. At its March 20 launch, BUIDL was billed as BlackRock\u2019s first tokenised fund issued on a public blockchain. It promised investors the opportunity to earn US dollar yields by subscribing through Securitize. The move was greeted with excitement by financial analysts. Research firm Bernstein called it \u201cthe next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last two decades.\u201d It\u2019s significant that BlackRock \u2014 by far the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2014 is throwing its weight behind tokenisation. CEO Larry Fink has touted tokenisation of all financial assets as the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of digital asset technologies in financial markets. The fund \u2014 which has a minimum buy-in of $5 million and is available to qualified investors only \u2014 is aimed at institutions looking to perform functions with digital cash. Its partners include the uber-traditional global custodian BNY Mellon, to safeguard the T-bills, as well as Coinbase and Fireblocks, which hold users\u2019 tokens. On April 11, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a smart contract service it said would provide BUIDL users with a near-instant conversion from the BUIDL token to USDC.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "headline": "Circle, Ripple and other crypto giants came to Paris for \u2018regulatory clarity\u2019 and returned with reality check",
                "keypoints": "The vibe in Paris last week was a mix of relief and uncertainty as crypto regime takes shape.\nThe EU may not be as crypto friendly as Americans expect.\nThe SEC's move on Uniswap was the talk of the conference last week.",
                "body": " Last Wednesday morning, Verena Ross, the executive director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, delivered a reality check to hundreds of crypto industry partisans attending Paris Blockchain Week. They were keen learn more about the European Union\u2019s famous \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d around crypto. It was such a welcome contrast to the crackdown pursued by US regulators. Yet Ross said MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets regulation \u2014 was no panacea for crypto ventures and she took issue with the notion that the EU was crypto-friendly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would necessarily use the word friendly,\u201d she told the 200 or so attendees. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in Europe is the legislators have created a genuine regulatory framework specifically for crypto. That replaces what was a bit of a patchwork of different national approaches.\u201d For many US crypto heads chafing under a regulatory crackdown back home, that sounded just fine. For four days last week, 10,000 or so devs, investors, media types, and assorted C-level bosses convened in the French capital to gather insights and network. Held in the Louvre\u2019s subterranean conference centre, attendees heard from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. BInance CEO Richard Teng (left) was reluctant to elaborate on the exchange's crisis in Nigeria during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. Photocredit: Paris Blockchain Week While Bitcoin ETFs and a heady market were very much top of mind, so too were the realities of operating in an increasingly regulated world. France, of all nations, has been doing its utmost to present itself as an antidote to such anxieties. With tax breaks and investment incentives, French officials have welcomed crypto ventures. \u201cWe had no other choice to make in Europe but France,\u201d said Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s chief strategy officer and global and head of policy, during a panel at the stablecoin issuer\u2019s event. \u201cOf course, not only the opportunities in the country, the depth of the capital markets, the depth of talent, the technology base, and, candidly, the regulatory clarity.\u201d But ESMA\u2019s Ross struck a sober note. \u201cThe key clearly, and that\u2019s a call for everyone here, is be prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate that there will be a new regime and therefore that you do need to be able to comply with that.\u201d Even so, Allaire and Circle, the issuer of the $32 billion USDC stablecoin, are betting big on France. In 2023, Circle obtained a conditional registration as a digital virtual asset provider in France and set up its European base in Paris. It also hired Coralie Billmann, a one-time payments exec at PayPal\u2019s Luxembourg office and at JPMorgan Chase in Paris, to spearhead the operation. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron invited 200 business leaders, including Disparte, to Versailles. With MiCA coming into force by the end of the year, national regulators in the EU\u2019s 27 member nations are busy formulating regulations to complement the landmark regime. The linchpin of the regime is ensuring crypto ventures all get registered and licenced so investors are protected from the predatory practices that are running rampant in other markets such as Asia. For crypto businesses such as Circle, the practice of \u201cpassporting\u201d will be crucial because it will enable them to offer their services to customers across the bloc from one locale. \u201cWe have set up an office and infrastructure so that we can issue our coins out of France,\u201d Billman said last Monday. \u201cWe want Europe and France to be a privileged market for our company.\u201d Austin Federer (left), head of strategy at Solana Foundation, talks with Dante Disparte, head of policy and CSO of Circle. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News Inside a former vault once used by the Bank of France, Allaire took the stage in the Pavillon Vend\u00f4me last week to promote Circle\u2019s euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and sketch out his strategic plan. \u201cToday, blockchain technologies, web three, digital assets, are becoming major national priorities all around the world,\u201d Allaire said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for the French government. It\u2019s a priority for the Japanese government. It\u2019s a priority for the Hong Kong government.\u201d To make his point, he presented one of his favourite crypto diagrams: A smaller circle inside of a larger circle. Jeremy Allaire, CEO and Founder of Circle, talks about the growth cycle in stablecoins. Photocredit: Liam Kelly/ DL News The smaller circle represents the value of stablecoins today \u2014 some $142 billion \u2014 and the larger circle represents the non-crypto version of electronic cash worldwide, more than $21 trillion. Allaire\u2019s point: Stablecoins are capable of growing by more than 850 times. And Circle, which is mulling an IPO this year, is going to be invaluable for clients and investors. Why? Because Circle follows the rules, says Allaire. And in France, that means MiCA. \u201cUSDC and we expect, under MiCA, EURC are going to play really critical roles in how digital cash moves in and out of all of these different capital market structures,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.\u201d Some US crypto execs at Paris Blockchain Week repeated the oft-said idea that the EU will pull crypto activity away from the US. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the US almost cede leadership in what is a transformational technology,\u201d Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple\u2019s senior vice president of strategy, told DL News. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple.

Back in Paris, there were other concerns, notably getting on the guest list for the best side events. That evening, conference attendees flooded Faust, a chic cocktail bar on the banks of the Seine. The Solana Foundation, a data provider called Pyth, and the buzzy memecoin Bonk were hosting a reception. Alice in Wonderland\u2019s card guards lined the red carpet leading into the bar. Inside, a white rabbit statue looked over partygoers. In the back, a court jester ushered others into a hidden speakeasy. Behind the venue\u2019s long bar stood a massive, red-and-white house of cards sculpture. Next to it, bright orange, red, and white lights shone the Bonk logo. Hardly anyone seemed phased by the SEC\u2019s move on DeFi\u2019s $7 billion trading platform. Uniswap Labs is, after all, based some 6,000 kilometres from Paris. Far from bearish crackdowns and enforcement actions. Instead, the vibe is far more optimistic. On the subject of Circle\u2019s potential IPO bid this year, one Circle employee had just one regret. \u201cI wish I had more equity,\u201d they told DL News.

                "headline": "Why DAOs are cashing out their tokens just as prices rise",
                "keypoints": "DAOs holding all their funds in their native token is risky.\nMore DAOs are looking to diversify their holdings as prices rise.\nDAO services provider recommends a DAO\u2019s native token not account for more than 90% of its treasury.",
                "body": " As crypto prices rise, more DAOs are weighing token sales to lock in cash reserves and fund operations. But that\u2019s not the only reason. They are increasingly wary of overdependence on their native tokens. The danger of this practice became clear last week, when Uniswap\u2019s UNI token tanked 20% after Uniswap Labs was slapped with a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201dRelying on one asset is risky as crypto assets are quite volatile,\u201d Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of DAO governance solutions provider StableLab and co-author of Uniswap\u2019s Treasury Working Group proposal, told DL News. On April 5, Uniswap DAO voted to establish a working group tasked with diversifying its $6.4 million treasury, held entirely in the DAO\u2019s native UNI token. Once established, the working group will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO after an eight-week research period. The problem isn\u2019t limited just to Uniswap. A recent report from DAO services provider Avantgarde commissioned by Arbitrum DAO found that among the 25 largest DAOs, almost two-thirds held over 90% of their treasuries in their DAO\u2019s native token. Decentralised autonomous organisations, often abbreviated to DAOs, are a type of crypto cooperative governed by token holders. While the DAO structure aids them in decentralisation, they are still very much like traditional companies in other ways. DAOs need to budget, cover expenses, and work toward sustainability. And timing is key as crypto prices rise. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for DAOs to diversify and ideally grow their treasury as that allows for a more resilient and sustainable DAO,\u201d Nam said. One example of a DAO with a diversified treasury is CoW DAO, which governs the CoW Swap decentralised exchange. The DAO holds around 88% of its treasury in its native COW token, with the remaining 12% distributed across stablecoins like Circle\u2019s USDC, MakerDAO\u2019s DAI, and staked and unstaked versions of Ether. \u201cThe treasury of a DAO is the lifeboat of the projects it supports,\u201d Luis, a CoW DAO treasury contributor, told DL News. Luis said that while a DAO\u2019s native token is important, diversifying assets is needed to minimise risk exposure and capture income opportunities. Opportunities for DAOs to bring in income have grown substantially in recent years. Many DAOs now choose to hold Ether liquid staking tokens such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. These tokens earn a yield of between 3% and 4% from Ether staking emissions. Nam also recommends DAOs hold some fiat currencies to further hedge against crypto volatility, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to hold some of their treasury in yield bearing stablecoins \u2014 assets that are pegged to the dollar but also earn a yield. But there are risks. Diversify too much, and it can put a lot of selling pressure on the DAO\u2019s native token, or worse, \u201clead to us being unaligned with the ARB token,\u201d Devansh Mehta, a member of Arbitrum DAO\u2019s treasury and sustainability working group, told DL News. According to StableLab\u2019s Nam, a 90% threshold, meaning that a DAO\u2019s native token doesn\u2019t account for more than 90% of its treasury, is a \u201cgood indicator\u201d for sufficient diversification. Surprisingly, several DAOs fall under 90%, including Uniswap, Nam said. Diversifying DAO treasuries can be unpopular for other reasons, too. According to Mehta, Arbitrum DAO members instead preferred to use the DAO\u2019s treasury to fund ecosystem growth. The compromise was proposing treasury diversification through real-world asset providers. \u201cThey wanted the legitimacy of Arbitrum DAO being a customer of their product and earning money from it,\u201d Mehta said. On April 6, Arbitrum DAO voted to diversify 35 million ARB from its treasury into stable, liquid- and yield-earning assets. A final consideration for DAOs looking to diversify their treasuries is the time it takes to coordinate tokens sales. For Arbitrum DAO, it took almost four months to go from a proposal to a final vote. Although Uniswap DAO has agreed to establish a working group, it will likely take many weeks before it comes up with a diversification proposal.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Lenders using decentralised finance protocol Goldfinch are facing a big hit after another large borrower defaulted on its debts. Borrower Lend East previously took out $10.2 million worth of loans backed by Goldfinch users. In an April 1 update, Warbler Labs, the company behind the Goldfinch protocol, announced Lend East would be able to repay only around $4.25 million of the loan, and said it expected Lend East to default on the remaining $5.9 million when the loan matured on April 3. \u201cWarbler Labs is engaging external counsel to explore all rights and remedies that are available to the community to maximise recovery,\u201d the company said. The situation with Lend East marks the third default users of the Goldfinch protocol have suffered since it started operating in January 2021. Critics say the repeated defaults highlight the difficulty of underwriting emerging-market loans and expose serious problems with the Goldfinch protocol\u2019s model. Goldfinch users say that the Lend East loan\u2019s initial credit assessment was \u201cpoorly executed\u201d and that both Goldfinch and Lend East failed to provide backers updates on the loan over the past year. The Goldfinch protocol lets its users underwrite undercollateralised loans to companies across the globe, many of which operate in emerging markets. In traditional finance, such loans are risky and therefore yield high returns. In DeFi, where double-digit annual returns are common, Goldfinch fits right in. \u201cUnderwriting emerging-market loans has always been difficult and putting them on crypto rails doesn\u2019t change that fact,\u201d Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at Tioga Capital Partners, told DL News. Ng said that weak regulations in emerging markets, generally low creditworthiness, and adverse selection all contribute to the difficulty. \u201cOnly the lowest quality borrowers will go to you, otherwise they would borrow from banks or credit funds,\u201d he said. Instead of conducting credit assessments for loans itself, Goldfinch relies on a decentralised group of auditors to approve borrowers for the protocol to consider. Those who backed the Lend East loan have accused the auditors of doing a poor job on the loan\u2019s initial credit assessment. \u201cInitial Goldfinch credit assessment has been poorly executed \u2014 or assessor poorly selected \u2014 as we end up with multiple default on multiple loans,\u201d a user posting under the name felix2545 said in the Goldfinch Discord \u2014 a messaging app. DL News asked Warbler Labs CEO Mike Sall and chief technology officer Blake West for comment. West directed DL News to Goldfinch\u2019s April 1 announcement and didn\u2019t comment further. Goldfinch\u2019s business model is not a new one. Banks and credit funds have long lent money in emerging markets, but calculating the risks of underwriting such loans is much more complex than lending in developed countries, such as the US. \u201cDeFi adds efficiency to structuring, capital formation, and deployment, but none of that matters if you don\u2019t have strong underwriting and recourse,\u201d Ryan Rodenbaugh, founder of crypto research and development company Wallfacer Labs, told DL News. Despite Goldfinch\u2019s best efforts, relying on third parties to source borrowers and assess risk may just be too difficult to make work. \u201cIt\u2019s a model problem,\u201d Ashish Anand, founder of asset tokenisation platform Bru Finance, told DL News. \u201cNot only Goldfinch, but anything that is structured as a credit fund where they rely upon third parties to do sourcing.\u201d Despite the defaults, Goldfinch has also facilitated 13 loans that were fully repaid. Another eight are listed on the Goldfinch website as \u201con time.\u201d The latest default represents 7.7% of the amount of all active loans outstanding on Goldfinch. Those burnt by the loss are now calling on Goldfinch to reimburse users with funds from the protocol\u2019s $107 million treasury. Combined with Goldfinch\u2019s previous defaults of a $5 million loan to Kenyan company Tugende, and $7 million from US-based credit fund Stratos, the protocol\u2019s total losses sit at almost $18 million. In the case of Stratos, Warbler Labs took on the full risk and responsibility of recovery, and backstopped losses for Goldfinch users. The Goldfinch DAO also voted to allocate $1 million in USDC from its treasury to cover losses from the Tugende loan. DL News asked Warbler Labs\u2019 West if the firm is considering backstopping the losses from Lend East\u2019s loans. He didn\u2019t immediately respond. Another one of Goldfinch\u2019s loans is also looking precarious. Almavest, a company that lends money to ESG-focused companies in India, Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, Spain, Philippines, and other markets, is currently late in repaying a $2.1 million loan. Whether Goldfinch will be able to bounce back from its recent default remains to be seen. \u201cTo solve the existing issues, they will need to go through the regulatory route and restructure debt,\u201d Tioga Capital\u2019s Ng said. \u201cThough this does not fix the long-term problem of poor underwriting.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.
