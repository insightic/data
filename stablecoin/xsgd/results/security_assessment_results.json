As prescribed by the Singapore Payment Services\nAct, a major payment institution has to put the following safeguards in place: a) an undertaking or\nguarantee by any bank in Singapore or prescribed financial institution to be fully liable to the customer\nfor such monies; b) a deposit in a trust account; or c) any other safeguards as may be prescribed by\nMAS.\nThus, XSGD reserves are fully segregated and bankruptcy-remote.\n \n\nXSGD relies on market participants to arbitrage differences between the market price of XSGD and the\nnet asset value of XSGD (typically, 1 SGD if XSGD is fully-collateralized). We believe this is the most\neffective price stability mechanism.\nWhen XSGD trades away from its peg, any user who has a KYC'd account with Xfers can mint or\nredeem XSGD for Singapore Dollars and make an instant profit. This risk-less profit opportunity\nattracts more participants and eventually pushes the market price of XSGD towards its peg.\nUsers who possess a KYC'd account with Xfers can redeem XSGD for Singapore Dollars.\n \n\nXFERS holds a Major Payment Institution License issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The\nPayment Services Act imposes a variety of conditions on licensees for the protection of customer assets.\nXfers is mandated to present audited financial statements to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n \n",
