However, it does mention that the supply controller can mint and burn tokens, and that the MKR token supply may increase through a Debt Auction to recapitalize the system. There is no mention of other distribution methods such as sales, airdrops, rewards, staking, claims, dividends, faucets, bounties, vesting, liquidity mining, farming/yield farming, treasury/fund allocation, payment for services/work, lottery/raffle, or referral programs in the provided context.\n\nConclusion: The token distribution mechanisms mentioned include minting and burning by the supply controller and increasing the MKR token supply through a Debt Auction for recapitalization purposes. No other specific distribution methods are detailed in the provided context.",
