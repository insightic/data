In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 32,727 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled. Settlement will be instantaneous. Then the FX ability of the blockchain...can happen at a microtransaction level.\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 For payments industry: Moving forward momentum of innovation (that comes in stages)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cFirst, increase the acceptance and make sure that it's as seamless as possible without drop off rate.

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

The most significant issues seem to involve the need for regular dry runs to identify omissions and areas for improvement, as well as the development of a response plan to build proficiency in handling various scenarios. Additionally, the creation of a template for documenting necessary improvements after each dry run is recommended. To enhance security measures, the report suggests increasing the frequency of dry runs for more likely scenarios and documenting these practices.",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 32,930 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled.

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 32,941 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled. Settlement will be instantaneous. Then the FX ability of the blockchain...can happen at a microtransaction level.\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 For payments industry: Moving forward momentum of innovation (that comes in stages)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cFirst, increase the acceptance and make sure that it's as seamless as possible without drop off rate. Then you go into costs. Can I make sure my cost is as low as possible, especially for cross border...Then the innovation, which is free game for a lot of guys to come in.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights and the full podcast on Insignia Business Review:https://lnkd.in/g5ZTtF9t\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/gVbMjfSCApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gyiryNiXYouTube:youtu.be/y-kEDB-ge_A\ud83d\udcf8 Photo from StraitsX",

(Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 32,974 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled.

(Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 32,999 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled.

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 33,102 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled.

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 33,143 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled. Settlement will be instantaneous. Then the FX ability of the blockchain...can happen at a microtransaction level.\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 For payments industry: Moving forward momentum of innovation (that comes in stages)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cFirst, increase the acceptance and make sure that it's as seamless as possible without drop off rate.

(Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 33,175 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled. Settlement will be instantaneous. Then the FX ability of the blockchain...can happen at a microtransaction level.\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 For payments industry: Moving forward momentum of innovation (that comes in stages)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cFirst, increase the acceptance and make sure that it's as seamless as possible without drop off rate.

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 33,230 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled. Settlement will be instantaneous. Then the FX ability of the blockchain...can happen at a microtransaction level.\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 For payments industry: Moving forward momentum of innovation (that comes in stages)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cFirst, increase the acceptance and make sure that it's as seamless as possible without drop off rate. Then you go into costs. Can I make sure my cost is as low as possible, especially for cross border...Then the innovation, which is free game for a lot of guys to come in.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights and the full podcast on Insignia Business Review:https://lnkd.in/g5ZTtF9t\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/gVbMjfSCApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gyiryNiXYouTube:youtu.be/y-kEDB-ge_A\ud83d\udcf8 Photo from StraitsX",

                "post_content": "Today we share a timely story on the value of localizing frontier technologies like digital assets on a regulatory and compliance level\n\nThis isTianwei Liu, Group Deputy CEO ofFazz. (Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",

In payments and fintech, you can't break things...You actually have to set the culture to do things right the first time and consider the impact on the customers and on people\u2026\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Participate in regulatory sandboxes and make the most of regulatory openness to experimentation.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201c[They] allow you to basically do the smallest field experiments, to demonstrate certain things before getting to your bigger customers\u2026\u201d\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Regulation opens doors to previously inaccessible market segments (e.g., FIs and banks) but the product makes the first step. \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cGetting these licenses and compliance helps to give you a stamp of approval. It is not enough, but it's definitely more helpful to at least help education move along. It also means that institutions are able then to adopt this blockchain technology...you can then serve a wider customer that traditionally would either be fearful or unable to reach.\u201d\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Time and place matter when it comes to regulation. There are also regulatory blue oceans as well and this factors into the growth potential of the business. \n\n\u201cSingapore is in a perfect position to do it, because of the regulation regime where you probably would think about China and other jurisdictions being geopolitically sensitive as well...potentially, this means for the whole entire region there will be a lot more adoption given that now Singapore has set the bar down.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the rest of the insights:https://lnkd.in/gKcWyCYV\ud83d\udc40 Or watch it on\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/g6D3_Z5vApple Podcasts:https://lnkd.in/gg36bWHNYouTube:https://lnkd.in/gKZ2aXRT",

A lot of us here are big believers.. and technology is at the heart of what we do. We\u2019re trying to solve problems. And we see that blockchain solutions do have merit to address things that traditional centralised systems [otherwise] cannot do. And that\u2019s why we have been very focused and interested in the [real-world] application of stablecoins.\"\n\nListen to Part 1 of the podcast below, and keep a look out for Part 2 soon! 33,274 followers \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f New podcast episode \ud83d\ude80 4 impacts ofStraitsXin-principle approval by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins XSGD and XUSD\n\nThis week\u2019s episode has returning guestTianwei Liu, Deputy CEO of Southeast Asia#fintechgroupFazz, the company behind digital asset infrastructure providerStraitsX. \n\nIn 2023\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival, StraitsX received in-principle approval by the MAS for the issuance of XSGD and XUSD, opening up opportunities we cover in this first half of our call with the seasoned fintech#entrepreneur. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 For Fazz: building on five years of pioneering blockchain transactions to unlock\u00a0more inter-currency corridors\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt's almost four or five years since we launched XSGD, and close to 8 billion XSGD has been transacted on-chain...it gives us the confidence that this is going to be a regulated industry...and beyond the Singapore dollars...we are now able to issue G10 currency stablecoins out of Singapore with this new license regime and XUSD, which is what we're gonna be focusing our effort on in the coming years.\u201d\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 For Singapore and ASEAN: More mainstream adoption with increased credibility and trust from regulators and institutions\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cIt brings about the credibility that using this kind of medium to facilitate innovation in payment is the way that regulators around the world should be looking at this...It allows service providers like us and other players to be able to confidently say that what we are doing is regulated and we are doing this according to the standards needed both on the AML control side, as well on custody and the way that we safeguard the user's funds.\u201d\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 For merchants and end-consumers: The same transactions, but faster, cheaper, and more interoperable thanks to blockchain technology (we cover the case of StraitsX collaborating with Grabpay and Alipay)\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \u201cWe can make this purpose-bound money the most purposeful and compliant by design...So the ML and compliance risk can be ring-fenced and properly controlled.

(Photo taken from when we took our limited partners to visit the Singapore Fazz office for our Annual Summit)\n\nTianwei is an engineer who returned to Singapore from Silicon Valley, and in 2015 started a payments infrastructure company thanks in part to some cross-border Christmas gift experiences (he shares more in our podcast). Along the way, an initiative came about internally to develop Singapore\u2019s first regulated stablecoin throughStraitsX. \n\nFast forward to 2023, their work in maturing this stablecoin marked a new milestone in last week\u2019sSingapore FinTech Festival.\n\nIn a speech (see link in the comments), theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2019s Managing Director Ravi Menon also announced that \u201cMAS has granted in-principle approval under the Payment Services Act to three entities who will issue stable coins that substantively comply with MAS\u2019 upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework\u2026Once the legislative amendments take effect, these stable coins will be regarded as \u201cMAS-regulated stablecoins\u201d. These includeStraitsXSGD issuance that will house the XSGD pegged stablecoin already on the market, and StraitsX USD Issuance. \n\nThis is a step forward in developing a truly sustainable digital currency. And through Project Orchid, well-regulated stable coins are already being trialled for use cases like purpose-bound money. For example, StraitsX enables XSGD-backed purpose-bound money to facilitate escrow arrangements in e-commerce transactions, ensuring that funds are released to merchants only when the customer receives the purchased items. It was also tested in the Festival, in partnership with Amazon and Grab.\n\nThis development comes full circle to what Tianwei shared on our podcast a year ago: \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a world that is going to be nominated in US dollars, everything is US dollars-based, but day-to-day wise, do we ever see a US dollar and we will use it as the ultimate payment [method]? \n\nI don\u2019t think that will ever happen. So we need to figure out how to make sure that there is a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem in the Asia Pacific. Be it Singaporean dollars, Indonesia rupiah, Philippine pesos or in Vietnamese dong, it has to be built out by the locals, and that will require us to be the pioneers. And actually working very closely with regulators to build out that ecosystem for ourselves.\u201d \n\nLocalization for startups is no longer just a matter of developing products for a specific market, but ensuring that the business is operationally compliant with local regulations. This presents an even greater competitive advantage for startups able to develop their compliance muscle. \n\nKudos to Tianwei and the StraitsX team for this milestone!#digitalassets#sff2023#straitsx#fazz#IVPAnnualSummit2023",
