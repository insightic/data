The assessments involve static code analysis, manual review, and dry run scenarios to identify and address vulnerabilities. The most critical issues revolve around identifying coding bugs and verifying them, as well as documenting and improving response plans for potential security incidents. The frequency and thoroughness of dry runs are emphasized to ensure the team develops a robust response to security threats. Potential improvements include creating templates for documenting necessary enhancements post-audit and increasing the regularity of dry runs for likely scenarios.",
