If the LLC is formed or qualified after December 21, 2024, then reporting must be made with the LLC\u2019s articles of organization or application for authority to do business in New York.\n\nThe Act\u2019s requirements mirror those of the Corporate Transparency Act (the \u201cCTA\u201d), which is the new federal law that became effective on January 1, 2024 and which\u00a0we previously summarized here.
