                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "keypoints": "A founder of TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing members of its C-suite.\nOusted CEO Daniel Jaiyong An accused the company of misleading investors and for breach of contract.\nAn alleged he was fired amid negotiations with Justin Sun to sell TrueUSD to Tron.",
                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit. We intend to file our response to Mr An\u2019s allegations in court shortly, which will provide clarity on the matter,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cGiven these matters are in litigation, we do not intend to make further comments outside of that process.\u201d If you have a tip on Archblock, TrueUSD, Tron or another story, please contact us at joanna@dlnews.com and eric@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Update, July 7: The overnight spike on the DeFiLlama data was clarified as related to Binance\u2019s communication of new addresses with the data tracker."

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry.

It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains.

Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token.

US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

But thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve and the US Department of the Treasury, TrueUSD, along with Signature\u2019s other depositors, don\u2019t have to worry about losing their money. The government guaranteed their assets will be safe and accessible. NOW READ: Bank meltdown crushes crypto regulation hopes: \u2018Crypto in the US is dead\u2019 The development demonstrates how an industry predicated on replacing central banks, commercial banks, and the other pillars of the traditional financial system are being saved by those very same institutions amid the worst crisis in confidence to strike the US since the crash of 2008. It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains. With crypto investors and founders nervous the banking crisis may intensify Washington\u2019s crackdown on their industry, the decentralised finance story is entering a crucial phase. NOW READ: Silvergate short seller says he\u2019s betting against Signature: \u2018Binance is next\u2019 And one of the biggest worries is losing access to banks like Signature. Based in New York, the 22-year-old lender with total assets of $110 billion at the end of 2022 and catered to cryptocurrency enterprises. It was one of the few banks comfortable with the risky nature of crypto clients and when Silvergate, a California institution that also banked crypto firms, went sideways this month it was only a matter of time before short sellers started targeting Signature. The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. \u201cThe US Government announced the closure and backstopping of Signature Bank,\u201d TrueUSD said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs a result, TrueCoin paused TUSD minting & redemption for our small number of Signature Bank users. Minting & redemption continues unaffected across the rest of our banking network.\u201d The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. While TrueUSD traded close to the $1 mark over the weekend, Circle\u2019s widely used USDC stablecoin plunged to 88 cents on Saturday, as did MakerDAO\u2019s DAI token, before both quickly recovered. The moves raised concerns about the interdependency of stablecoins and TradFi banks. Signature said at the end of last year that about 20% of its deposits are from the crypto industry, and the bank was keen on reducing that portion after FTX, the second largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt in November. NOW READ: SEC vs crypto: A timeline of enforcement actions TrueUSD is issued by a platform called TrustToken, which announced last year that it sold the rights to its stablecoin to an Asia-based conglomerate called Techteryx. TrustToken said at the time that it would continue to be involved in running TUSD. On Monday afternoon, TUSD updated the label for Signature to \u201cSignet.\u201d Signet is Signature Bank\u2019s blockchain-enabled payments platform and is popular with its institutional clients. Signet will continue to operate after Signature Bank\u2019s shutdown, according to a report."

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron.

                "keypoints": "A founder of TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing members of its C-suite.\nOusted CEO Daniel Jaiyong An accused the company of misleading investors and for breach of contract.\nAn alleged he was fired amid negotiations with Justin Sun to sell TrueUSD to Tron.",
                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit. We intend to file our response to Mr An\u2019s allegations in court shortly, which will provide clarity on the matter,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cGiven these matters are in litigation, we do not intend to make further comments outside of that process.\u201d If you have a tip on Archblock, TrueUSD, Tron or another story, please contact us at joanna@dlnews.com and eric@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

Critics of the bill contend that DeFi smart contracts are built to be immutable, and that the new law would undermine that core component of their design.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin with a market cap of $2 billion, had 40% of its dollar-backed stablecoin\u2019s reserves sitting at Signature Bank, which was shut down by New York state regulators on Sunday. Yet unlike Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, which plunged and then rebounded over the weekend on worries over its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, TUSD has barely moved at all. NOW READ: Bitcoin ignores macro moves, says the NY Fed. Experts disagree TrueUSD\u2019s website showed that almost $800 million, or 40% of TUSD\u2019s total bank balances, was in deposits at Signature Bank as of Monday. But thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve and the US Department of the Treasury, TrueUSD, along with Signature\u2019s other depositors, don\u2019t have to worry about losing their money. The government guaranteed their assets will be safe and accessible. NOW READ: Bank meltdown crushes crypto regulation hopes: \u2018Crypto in the US is dead\u2019 The development demonstrates how an industry predicated on replacing central banks, commercial banks, and the other pillars of the traditional financial system are being saved by those very same institutions amid the worst crisis in confidence to strike the US since the crash of 2008. It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains. With crypto investors and founders nervous the banking crisis may intensify Washington\u2019s crackdown on their industry, the decentralised finance story is entering a crucial phase. NOW READ: Silvergate short seller says he\u2019s betting against Signature: \u2018Binance is next\u2019 And one of the biggest worries is losing access to banks like Signature. Based in New York, the 22-year-old lender with total assets of $110 billion at the end of 2022 and catered to cryptocurrency enterprises. It was one of the few banks comfortable with the risky nature of crypto clients and when Silvergate, a California institution that also banked crypto firms, went sideways this month it was only a matter of time before short sellers started targeting Signature. The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. \u201cThe US Government announced the closure and backstopping of Signature Bank,\u201d TrueUSD said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs a result, TrueCoin paused TUSD minting & redemption for our small number of Signature Bank users. Minting & redemption continues unaffected across the rest of our banking network.\u201d The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. While TrueUSD traded close to the $1 mark over the weekend, Circle\u2019s widely used USDC stablecoin plunged to 88 cents on Saturday, as did MakerDAO\u2019s DAI token, before both quickly recovered. The moves raised concerns about the interdependency of stablecoins and TradFi banks. Signature said at the end of last year that about 20% of its deposits are from the crypto industry, and the bank was keen on reducing that portion after FTX, the second largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt in November. NOW READ: SEC vs crypto: A timeline of enforcement actions TrueUSD is issued by a platform called TrustToken, which announced last year that it sold the rights to its stablecoin to an Asia-based conglomerate called Techteryx. TrustToken said at the time that it would continue to be involved in running TUSD. On Monday afternoon, TUSD updated the label for Signature to \u201cSignet.\u201d Signet is Signature Bank\u2019s blockchain-enabled payments platform and is popular with its institutional clients. Signet will continue to operate after Signature Bank\u2019s shutdown, according to a report."

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged.

At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News.

Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16.

Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit.

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry.

US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase.

Yet unlike Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, which plunged and then rebounded over the weekend on worries over its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, TUSD has barely moved at all. NOW READ: Bitcoin ignores macro moves, says the NY Fed. Experts disagree TrueUSD\u2019s website showed that almost $800 million, or 40% of TUSD\u2019s total bank balances, was in deposits at Signature Bank as of Monday. But thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve and the US Department of the Treasury, TrueUSD, along with Signature\u2019s other depositors, don\u2019t have to worry about losing their money. The government guaranteed their assets will be safe and accessible. NOW READ: Bank meltdown crushes crypto regulation hopes: \u2018Crypto in the US is dead\u2019 The development demonstrates how an industry predicated on replacing central banks, commercial banks, and the other pillars of the traditional financial system are being saved by those very same institutions amid the worst crisis in confidence to strike the US since the crash of 2008. It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains. With crypto investors and founders nervous the banking crisis may intensify Washington\u2019s crackdown on their industry, the decentralised finance story is entering a crucial phase. NOW READ: Silvergate short seller says he\u2019s betting against Signature: \u2018Binance is next\u2019 And one of the biggest worries is losing access to banks like Signature. Based in New York, the 22-year-old lender with total assets of $110 billion at the end of 2022 and catered to cryptocurrency enterprises. It was one of the few banks comfortable with the risky nature of crypto clients and when Silvergate, a California institution that also banked crypto firms, went sideways this month it was only a matter of time before short sellers started targeting Signature. The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. \u201cThe US Government announced the closure and backstopping of Signature Bank,\u201d TrueUSD said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs a result, TrueCoin paused TUSD minting & redemption for our small number of Signature Bank users. Minting & redemption continues unaffected across the rest of our banking network.\u201d The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. While TrueUSD traded close to the $1 mark over the weekend, Circle\u2019s widely used USDC stablecoin plunged to 88 cents on Saturday, as did MakerDAO\u2019s DAI token, before both quickly recovered. The moves raised concerns about the interdependency of stablecoins and TradFi banks. Signature said at the end of last year that about 20% of its deposits are from the crypto industry, and the bank was keen on reducing that portion after FTX, the second largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt in November. NOW READ: SEC vs crypto: A timeline of enforcement actions TrueUSD is issued by a platform called TrustToken, which announced last year that it sold the rights to its stablecoin to an Asia-based conglomerate called Techteryx.

Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender.

At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance.

TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance.

TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing.

Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months.

The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance.

Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

NOW READ: How the SEC\u2019s showdown with Coinbase will change the crypto market for everyone Major crypto firms Solana and Polygon shot back against the US Securities Exchange Commission over the weekend, after the agency made allegations that the firms\u2019 respective SOL and MATIC tokens are securities. Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender.

At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021.

Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16.

(Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "body": " The ousted CEO of stablecoin TrueUSD developer Archblock is suing his former colleagues, alleging they muscled him out of the business so they could keep enriching themselves at the expense of investors. Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged. In July 2020, Cosman \u2014 along with TrustLabs finance director Alex de Lorraine and board member and advisor Tom Shields \u2014 led a vote to unseat An and install Cosman as CEO. At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing. An was defenestrated as negotiations with Tron were being finalised, leaving him unable to represent the interests of the SAFT investors, amid continued legal threats from the defendants, the lawsuit claimed. \u2018Mr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit\u2019 NOW READ: Lawyers lay out what\u2019s at stake in Curve founder lawsuit Archblock rejected the claims made in the lawsuit. \u201cMr An\u2019s current allegations will be shown to be without merit. We intend to file our response to Mr An\u2019s allegations in court shortly, which will provide clarity on the matter,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cGiven these matters are in litigation, we do not intend to make further comments outside of that process.\u201d If you have a tip on Archblock, TrueUSD, Tron or another story, please contact us at joanna@dlnews.com and eric@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry.

US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

Yet unlike Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, which plunged and then rebounded over the weekend on worries over its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, TUSD has barely moved at all.

Experts disagree TrueUSD\u2019s website showed that almost $800 million, or 40% of TUSD\u2019s total bank balances, was in deposits at Signature Bank as of Monday. But thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve and the US Department of the Treasury, TrueUSD, along with Signature\u2019s other depositors, don\u2019t have to worry about losing their money. The government guaranteed their assets will be safe and accessible. NOW READ: Bank meltdown crushes crypto regulation hopes: \u2018Crypto in the US is dead\u2019 The development demonstrates how an industry predicated on replacing central banks, commercial banks, and the other pillars of the traditional financial system are being saved by those very same institutions amid the worst crisis in confidence to strike the US since the crash of 2008. It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains. With crypto investors and founders nervous the banking crisis may intensify Washington\u2019s crackdown on their industry, the decentralised finance story is entering a crucial phase. NOW READ: Silvergate short seller says he\u2019s betting against Signature: \u2018Binance is next\u2019 And one of the biggest worries is losing access to banks like Signature. Based in New York, the 22-year-old lender with total assets of $110 billion at the end of 2022 and catered to cryptocurrency enterprises. It was one of the few banks comfortable with the risky nature of crypto clients and when Silvergate, a California institution that also banked crypto firms, went sideways this month it was only a matter of time before short sellers started targeting Signature. The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. \u201cThe US Government announced the closure and backstopping of Signature Bank,\u201d TrueUSD said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs a result, TrueCoin paused TUSD minting & redemption for our small number of Signature Bank users. Minting & redemption continues unaffected across the rest of our banking network.\u201d The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. While TrueUSD traded close to the $1 mark over the weekend, Circle\u2019s widely used USDC stablecoin plunged to 88 cents on Saturday, as did MakerDAO\u2019s DAI token, before both quickly recovered. The moves raised concerns about the interdependency of stablecoins and TradFi banks. Signature said at the end of last year that about 20% of its deposits are from the crypto industry, and the bank was keen on reducing that portion after FTX, the second largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt in November. NOW READ: SEC vs crypto: A timeline of enforcement actions TrueUSD is issued by a platform called TrustToken, which announced last year that it sold the rights to its stablecoin to an Asia-based conglomerate called Techteryx.

Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender.

At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said.

                "body": " Binance holds almost 90% of TrueUSD after a recent spike that saw more than $2 billion of the dollar-pegged stablecoin move to the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

Prime Trust has said users can still deposit dollars and mint TUSD via the company\u2019s other banking partners. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

                "keypoints": "DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has introduced a second vote on lending protocol Aave to adjust risk posed by Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan.\nHowever, some DAO members have called foul after a similar vote was rejected last month.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has once again advised its client Aave, a major DeFi lending protocol, to take action against a risk that could cost it a lot of money. However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin with a market cap of $2 billion, had 40% of its dollar-backed stablecoin\u2019s reserves sitting at Signature Bank, which was shut down by New York state regulators on Sunday. Yet unlike Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, which plunged and then rebounded over the weekend on worries over its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, TUSD has barely moved at all. NOW READ: Bitcoin ignores macro moves, says the NY Fed. Experts disagree TrueUSD\u2019s website showed that almost $800 million, or 40% of TUSD\u2019s total bank balances, was in deposits at Signature Bank as of Monday. But thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve and the US Department of the Treasury, TrueUSD, along with Signature\u2019s other depositors, don\u2019t have to worry about losing their money. The government guaranteed their assets will be safe and accessible. NOW READ: Bank meltdown crushes crypto regulation hopes: \u2018Crypto in the US is dead\u2019 The development demonstrates how an industry predicated on replacing central banks, commercial banks, and the other pillars of the traditional financial system are being saved by those very same institutions amid the worst crisis in confidence to strike the US since the crash of 2008. It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains. With crypto investors and founders nervous the banking crisis may intensify Washington\u2019s crackdown on their industry, the decentralised finance story is entering a crucial phase. NOW READ: Silvergate short seller says he\u2019s betting against Signature: \u2018Binance is next\u2019 And one of the biggest worries is losing access to banks like Signature. Based in New York, the 22-year-old lender with total assets of $110 billion at the end of 2022 and catered to cryptocurrency enterprises. It was one of the few banks comfortable with the risky nature of crypto clients and when Silvergate, a California institution that also banked crypto firms, went sideways this month it was only a matter of time before short sellers started targeting Signature. The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. \u201cThe US Government announced the closure and backstopping of Signature Bank,\u201d TrueUSD said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAs a result, TrueCoin paused TUSD minting & redemption for our small number of Signature Bank users. Minting & redemption continues unaffected across the rest of our banking network.\u201d The downfall of Silicon Valley Bank last week made Signature a target for regulators. While TrueUSD traded close to the $1 mark over the weekend, Circle\u2019s widely used USDC stablecoin plunged to 88 cents on Saturday, as did MakerDAO\u2019s DAI token, before both quickly recovered. The moves raised concerns about the interdependency of stablecoins and TradFi banks. Signature said at the end of last year that about 20% of its deposits are from the crypto industry, and the bank was keen on reducing that portion after FTX, the second largest crypto exchange, went bankrupt in November. NOW READ: SEC vs crypto: A timeline of enforcement actions TrueUSD is issued by a platform called TrustToken, which announced last year that it sold the rights to its stablecoin to an Asia-based conglomerate called Techteryx. TrustToken said at the time that it would continue to be involved in running TUSD. On Monday afternoon, TUSD updated the label for Signature to \u201cSignet.\u201d Signet is Signature Bank\u2019s blockchain-enabled payments platform and is popular with its institutional clients. Signet will continue to operate after Signature Bank\u2019s shutdown, according to a report."

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

Archblock co-founder Daniel Jaiyong An said in the complaint, filed with a Delaware court on July 14, that he was pushed out as CEO in mid-2020. At the time, he had been in talks with billionaire Justin Sun over the sale of TrueUSD \u2014 the $2.8 billion stablecoin \u2014 to Sun\u2019s blockchain company Tron, according to the suit, seen by DL News. \u2018The lawsuit has nothing to do with me\u2019 \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d Sun told DL News. \u201cIt is [a] former Archblock employee suing Archblock.\u201d He did not respond to questions about whether Tron tried to buy TrueUSD in 2020, as the lawsuit alleged. A deal for TrueUSD did end up going through that year. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020, yet Archblock had continued to manage TrueUSD\u2019s operations. Techteryx, which isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit, will take over \u201cfull management of all offshore operations and services related to TUSD,\u201d an Archblock subsidiary announced on the same day as the lawsuit was filed. The Archblock lawsuit makes only passing reference to Sun. It details how in July 2020, An was pushed out of the company he had founded along with Rafael Cosman. In 2017 and 2019, TrustLabs had issued a kind of investment contract called a \u201csimple agreement for future tokens.\u201d The idea was to raise funds for the development of a tokenisation platform. The TrustLabs SAFT gave investors the right to receive TRU tokens by 2023, with the understanding that they were funding the platform\u2019s development. The SAFT raised $35 million for TrustLabs, which released TrueUSD and the TRU tokens in 2018. NOW READ: Stake.com deadline nears: Billionaire founder sued by ex partner over marketing of world\u2019s biggest crypto casino In 2020, Cosman began pivoting away from the tokenisation platform to other revenue opportunities, however. This resulted in a rewards programme for holders of TrueUSD called TrueRewards, later rebranded to TrueFi, the lawsuit alleged. An feared TrustLabs\u2019 new business model was a far cry from what they had promised investors, the filings said. An wanted to disclose the pivot to investors and offer a refund opportunity, or risk being in breach of securities law, especially as the venture started to look more like a blockchain lender. NOW READ: Celsius staff knew \u2018value was fake,\u2019 allege Feds in multiple legal cases against Alex Mashinsky But Cosman and senior staff feared losing their cash cow if they disclosed the new direction to investors, the suit alleged.

At this point, An was negotiating the sale of TrueUSD to blockchain company Tron, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit includes screenshots of what appears to be a conversation between An and Sun negotiating the sale of TrueUSD. Sun appears to have demanded that the transaction be kept private, while An pushed back. \u2018That\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible that we do a transaction and it remains privy to a few people \u2014 that\u2019s like handing over the keys to $140 million in escrow and the power to print money and no relevant stakeholders are told,\u201d An told Sun during the exchange, according to screenshots of a Telegram chat submitted in the filing.

Dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD\u2019s circulating supply was just above $3 billion Thursday afternoon, according to the token\u2019s website and crypto price tracker CoinGecko. Binance holds almost $2.7 billion, according to DefiLlama data. TrueUSD spikes on Binance (Aleks Gilbert) Binance\u2019s TUSD holdings appears to have spiked on DeFiLlama today after the exchange shared an updated batch of addresses with the data tracker, DeFiLlama told DL News. DeFiLlama said although the site live-tracks Binance\u2019s holdings, the exchange regularly changes its addresses and periodically declares them. Binance may have added a new address holding TUSD a while ago, DeFiLlama said, but the site wouldn\u2019t track it until today\u2019s declaration from Binance. A representative for Archblock, the San Francisco-headquartered firm that issues TrueUSD, did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. TrueUSD is the fifth largest stablecoin, and the only major dollar-pegged stablecoin to have grown in market capitalisation in 2023, due in part to its heavy promotion by Binance. As of June 30, Binance does not charge maker fees on all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in As a result, TUSD\u2019s trade volumes \u201care almost exclusively concentrated\u201d on Binance, according to crypto research firm Kaiko. Daily TUSD trade volumes on decentralised exchanges averaged about $2 million in the second quarter of 2023, the firm said in a research report published Monday, and about $2 billion on Binance. Of the $3 billion TUSD in circulation, more than $2.2 billion are on the Tron blockchain. Another $700 million are on Ethereum. TUSD supply by blockchain (Aleks Gilbert) It\u2019s unclear clear why Binance has recently become the largest holder of TUSD \u2014 especially at a time when the stablecoin has faced scrutiny due to its association with Nevada-based crypto custodian Prime Trust. The recent collapse of Prime Trust set off concerns regarding TUSD\u2019s backing. NOW READ: BlackRock\u2019s aim to make crypto cheaper should scare Coinbase Earlier this year, hundreds of millions of dollars of TUSD collateral was deposited with Prime Trust. Last week, Nevada\u2019s financial watchdog said the company was insolvent, with a shortfall of roughly $80 million and AUDIO, the governance token of NFT music platform Audius, accounting for most of its remaining assets. Prime Trust holds almost one-third of the AUDIO in circulation, meaning any fire sale would move the token\u2019s price and likely net it less than the $60 million it is worth today.

However, critics described the move as an attempt to \u201csneak back in\u201d a proposal that the protocol\u2019s governance had already rejected. The vote highlights the intricacies of DeFi governance, the disproportionate risk posed by one debt position, but also the overall transparency of it all. Aave is governed by a community of token holders, some of whom are represented by delegates. Gauntlet, an Aave service provider on a $2 million annual fee is tasked with analysing the safety of lending and borrowing parameters on the protocol. Anything Gauntlet recommends must go through a governance procedure that requires proposals posted on an online forum, discussions, and a vote. Gauntlet proposed last month that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate against the risks posed by loan position on the crypto lending protocol. The loan in question belongs to Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov, who borrowed $65 million on Aave v2 by collateralising $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply. \u2018I thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again.\u2019 Aave DAO delegates unanimously rejected Gauntlet\u2019s proposal. Now Gauntlet has proposed a second vote on the same issue. \u201cGauntlet continues to recommend freezing CRV and setting the CRV LTV to 0, despite the AIP failing to pass,\u201d the company said on June 27, referring to its previously failed proposal earlier in the month. The latest proposal to address the supposedly risky debt position is baked into a broader set of unrelated recommendations to the DAO, which led to accusations that the Gauntlet was trying to \u201csneak it back in.\u201d If the omnibus proposal were to pass, then the freeze would pass too. \u201cI thought it was rejected by the community already, but Gauntlet includes it again and again,\u201d Egorov told DL News. NOW READ: A new project tests how DeFi can power the trillion-dollar currency market in \u2018future tokenised world\u2019 Tarun Chitra, CEO and founder Gauntlet, told DL News that the firm \u201cwas just double checking the temperature check\u201d and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any malicious intent \u2014 as has been [stated] by some.\u201d DAO governance temperature checks gauge sentiment among governance token holders about a proposal before it proceeds to a final execution vote. \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Chitra told DL News. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the temp check will fail, and we will take that as a definitive signal and continue to balance risk/reward with that in mind across v2,\u201d he said. Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller said on the DAO\u2019s governance forum on Wednesday Gauntlet\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe governance already stated clearly their opinion on this very topic via a previous vote,\u201d he said. Zeller pointed to his governance forum posts when DL News requested for comment. Chitra told DL News the move was \u201cpartially due to the fact that there was some community pressure regarding changing LTVs on TUSD.\u201d The DAO executed a proposal on July 3 to lower the risk associated with borrowing TrueUSD\u2019s stablecoin TUSD on Aave v2. The fears over TUSD stemmed from stablecoin issuer Prime Trust\u2019s insolvency, but TrueUSD said it no longer uses Prime Trust. Egorov has a lot of Curve tokens thanks to his work on the protocol. And instead of selling those tokens, he takes out a loan on them. While the loan has a health factor of 1.85, which indicates a low probability of liquidation risk, Gauntlet last month called it a risky position that could leave Aave with bad debt if Curve token\u2019s liquidity shrinks. \u201cCRV token liquidity has [...] decreased 50% over the past couple of months, both on chain and globally,\u201d Gauntlet warned Aave DAO members on June 12. \u201cThis can cause future risk, especially if the CRV used as collateral by this account continues to grow.\u201d NOW READ: VC trio sues Curve founder for \u2018deception\u2019 and handling of trade secrets Egorov says he will have to act quickly if the proposal ever passes through. \u201cProbably my incentive, if the vote passes, would be [to] take as much as possible on Aave before the vote is enacted \u2014 because I will not be able to borrow more in the future \u2014 and only be reducing the position depending on Curve price in the future,\u201d Egorov told DL News. \u201cBut in my opinion, that\u2019s a bad incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be rotating it to Aave v3 because one cannot disable borrowing of CRV there \u2014 and I don\u2019t want my CRV borrowed.\u201d Avraham Eisenberg \u2014 known for his $110 million Mango Markets hack last year \u2014 once hunted this position in November by shorting Curve but ended up losing $10 million. Aave, however, had to repay $1.6 million in bad debt due to the attack. Gauntlet\u2019s latest attempt to freeze the tokens, however, appears not to have elicited the same level of attention, judging by the lack of engagement on the forum and in the wider community. NOW READ: Sam Altman-backed Reserve makes $20m Curve Wars power play Gauntlet put the matter up for a preliminary Snapshot vote on Tuesday that is scheduled to end on July 7. The results of the vote are currently encrypted as the poll is utilising Snapshot\u2019s shielded voting feature which keeps the tally hidden until the end of the vote. Zeller said on the forum that his Aave Chan Initiative would vote no to the proposal. Data from Snapshot shows Zeller voting with 234,000 Aave tokens, more than 15 times the voting power of the second-highest voting address. Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations could be included in an on-chain vote if the Snapshot poll passes. Disclaimer: The two co-founders of DL News were previously core contributors to the Curve protocol.

                "body": " Happy Monday! This weekend, we saw the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook fame \u2014 take another stab at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed the big \u201cred flag\u201d he had about disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, took to Twitter on Sunday. He labelled the market watchdog\u2019s refusal so far to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as \u201ca complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.\u201d The outburst came 10 years after the twins filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, and on the back a string of firms including Fidelity and BlackRock filing to launch similar products. Buterin rejected the idea that disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was respected among the crypto community before the collapse of the exchange when he appeared on the The Aarthi and Sriram Show this weekend. Vitalik said that what \u201cstood out as a red flag on FTX\u201d and SBF was that \u201che was not just able to articulate a vision of why crypto is good\u201d and that he was only \u201cregurgitating\u201d what had \u201cbeen said by influencers for years.\u201d Another day, another crypto hack. Poly Network has become the victim of a digital heist that affected 57 crypto assets across 10 blockchains on July 2, according to the protocol. In a string of tweets on Sunday, the cross-chain bridge platform urged cybersecurity experts to come to its aid and that it hoped \u201cthe attacker will cooperate and return the user assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.\u201d There is an air of thaw in the crypto winter after financial Goliaths like BlackRock and Fidelity announced plans to muscle further into the industry. However, new figures from data provider RootData shows that venture capital investments into the sector dropped by over 70% between June 2022 and the same month this year. Investment fell from $1.81 billion across 149 rounds in June last year to $520 million across 83 rounds for June 2023. Or to put it this way: despite all the market bullishness and Bitcoin rallies, monthly VC investments are at their lowest point in the past 12 months. DeFi protocol Aave\u2019s community voted to freeze the TrueUSD reserve on the Wave V2 Ethereum pool following \u201crecent events with the TUSD asset.\u201d The proposal didn\u2019t clarify what events it was referring to, but TrueUSD was recently revealed to have a small exposure to defunct off-ramp provider Prime trust. Over 561,000 Aave community members, representing about 84% of the vote, backed the proposal.

Polygon Labs, which operates both the Polygon layer two network on Ethereum as well as its own native Polygon blockchain network, stated in a Saturday tweet that the firm neither originated in nor specifically targeted the US market. The Solana Foundation said it \u201cdisagrees with the characterisation of SOL as a security\u201d and urged for legal clarity from US regulators. The SEC named some 12 cryptocurrencies in its June 5 lawsuit against leading global exchange Binance, among them SOL, MATIC, and Cardano\u2019s ADA token. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission won a precedent-setting victory against decentralised autonomous organisation Ooki DAO on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled in favour of the agency on grounds Ooki DAO offered the sale of unregistered commodities. US Judge William H. Orrick ordered Ooki DAO to pay $643,542 in fines, and to cease operations and shutter its website. The move is a major enforcement milestone against a DeFi organisation, against a backdrop of litigation targeted towards largely centralised entities such as Binance and Coinbase. It remains to be seen how the Judge Orrick\u2019s orders will be enforced, as Ooki DAO did not partake in or acknowledge the lawsuit \u2014 though it did restrict US internet activity to the site.

It also shows that the champions of decentralised finance remain dependent on old-fashioned banks to move assets between the fiat and crypto domains.
