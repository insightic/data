Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4.

The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

The dialogue opened up perspectives on the power of consumer choice in the future of currency. \n\nThe spotlight on stablecoins is brighter than ever, especially considering their expanding use cases, from streamlining payroll, payments, to banking the unbanked. It is also clear that the conversation around regulatory frameworks for stablecoins is just as crucial as their development and the need for a balanced approach that foster#innovationwhile ensuring security and#trustin the system.#FDUSD#BinanceBlockchainWeek#CBDC#FinancialInclusion#Regulation#Asia",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4.

The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

The dialogue opened up perspectives on the power of consumer choice in the future of currency. \n\nThe spotlight on stablecoins is brighter than ever, especially considering their expanding use cases, from streamlining payroll, payments, to banking the unbanked. It is also clear that the conversation around regulatory frameworks for stablecoins is just as crucial as their development and the need for a balanced approach that foster#innovationwhile ensuring security and#trustin the system.#FDUSD#BinanceBlockchainWeek#CBDC#FinancialInclusion#Regulation#Asia",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4.

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4.

The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5.

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4.

The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5.

This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

The most significant issues are the lack of access to real-time analytics for identifying key influencers and the inability to analyze posts for bot-like characteristics. The absence of invite links and a focus on legitimate updates suggest authenticity in the content. A potential improvement could be integrating access to real-time social media analytics for more accurate assessments.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",

Let\u2019s learn more about $FDUSD.\n\n1. Redeemable: Holders have the ability to redeem their#FDUSDtokens at a similar value for U.S. dollars, as FDUSD is backed by high-quality cash reserves and cash equivalents. This offers users peace of mind knowing their digital currency holds real and retrievable value.\n\n2. Backed by quality assets: FDUSD is designed to maintain a stable price, which can appeal to those looking to deal with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. FDUSD reserves are segregated from the custodian\u2019s own funds, separating users' assets from any financial troubles of the custodian. Under the stewardship of First Digital Trust Limited, FDUSD reserves are more secure and protected, which contributes towards FDUSD\u2019s stability.\n\n3. Programmable: FDUSD\u2019s programmability enables the execution of smart contracts, escrow services, and insurance arrangements without the need for intermediaries. This paves the way for users to have more control over their financial transactions, enhancing transactional efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n4. Low fees: The cost-efficiency of blockchain-based transactions reduces associated fees, a stark contrast to traditional financial systems. The lower cost of FDUSD transactions presents an alternative for users, enabling broader accessibility and financial inclusion. \n\n5. Operates on decentralized networks: FDUSD works on decentralized networks distributed across multiple nodes. This means no single point of failure can compromise the system, enhancing security, transparency, and resilience.",
