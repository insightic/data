                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "headline": "These five charts explain TrueUSD\u2019s fall below its dollar peg \u2014 and Binance\u2019s role in the move",
                "keypoints": "Binance's decision to omit TUSD from its so-called Launchpool program might have contributed to the stablecoin losing parity with the dollar.\nDemand for stablecoins is heavily tied to their utility on Binance, according to Kaiko.",
                "body": " TrueUSD, the fifth largest stablecoin by market value, has been slipping against the dollar. Dubbed TUSD, the stablecoin started falling on January 9 and plummeted to a low of $0.926 on exchange Poloniex on January 16. Stablecoin ratings agency Bluechip \u2014 which in June advised against the use of TUSD, ranking it a D, just above its lowest F rating \u2014 points to a few factors driving the recent depeg. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to anchor to the value of other assets, typically the US dollar. Investors love them because they provide refuge from more volatile digital assets. Binance\u2019s decision to omit TUSD from recent so-called Launchpool projects Manta and AltLayer \u2014 while scrapping promotions for zero-fee trading for the stablecoin \u2014 has put pressure on TrueUSD. Launchpool allows participants to deposit, or stake, certain tokens, like Binance-affliated BNB, First Digital\u2019s FDUSD, and TUSD, in exchange for accumulating rewards in the form of new tokens, shoring up liquidity in the process. \u201cFor unclear reasons, Binance\u2019s two Launchpools last week only offered staking of BNB and FDUSD, kicking out TUSD,\u201d data analytics firm Kaiko said in a report on Monday. \u201cExclusion from the Launchpools is indicative of Binance\u2019s reducing support\u201d for the TrueUSD stablecoin, Bluechip wrote in its report. The move is \u201cprompting trades to sell TUSD for FDUSD.\u201d Circulating supply of TUSD and FDUSD. (Bluechip) Indeed, First Digital\u2019s stablecoin FDUSD has seen a $786 million in gains following TUSD\u2019s slip from the $1 peg, while TUSD\u2019s market share has fallen to 1.4%, losing $307 million. TUSD\u2019s total circulating supply has slipped to about $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, the total circulating supply of all stablecoins is up 2.3% to about $133 billion in year-to-date terms, DefiLlama data shows. \u201cWe have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities,\u201d TrueUSD wrote on January 18 on X, pointing to a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments.\u201d But Bluechip cast doubt on this explanation, saying the depeg had begun a week before Manta and Altlayer pools launched on January 15 and 17, respectively. Another reason for TUSD\u2019s recent volatility could be linked to Binance stopping its zero-fee trading promotion with the stablecoin. Binance consistently accounts for over 99% of TUSD\u2019s volume, according to data analytics firm Kaiko. \u201cDespite high volumes for FDUSD, both stablecoins have largely failed to catch on for use beyond Binance\u2019s zero-fee pairs,\u201d Kaiko said. TUSD and FDUSD weekly volumes (Kaiko) \u201cThere had been about $150 million of net TUSD selling,\u201d leading up to the announcement, Kaiko said. The data analytics firm measures this using what\u2019s called Cumulative Volume Delta, or CVD. This trading indicator adds up the differences between the buying and selling volumes over time to help investors understand the relationship between price moves and trading volume. A negative CVD means there are more sellers in the market. This abundance of selling led to a \u201cfairly common TUSD depeg,\u201d Kaiko said, which \u201cescalated as soon as users realised that TUSD\u2019s top use case had vanished.\u201d TUSD cumulative volume delta and price on Binance (Kaiko) TrueUSD says it has the reserves to back TUSD, and uses an attestation process to prove it. But the accounting agencies it uses, The Network Firm and MooreHK, do not use humans to manually verify the source data, Bluechip said. \u201cThe attestations are fully-automated reports, generated in real-time using data feeds from third parties,\u201d it wrote. TrueUSD did not immediately return a request for comment on the Bluechip report, but has countered questions about its reporting methods. \u201cRegular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect,\u201d TUSD wrote last week on X. TUSD's reserves breakdown (Bluechip) \u201cPoor security practices at entities associated with TUSD do not instil confidence among TUSD holders,\u201d Bluechip wrote. TrueUSD said in October it experienced a data breach at a third-party vendor. A British Virgin Island-incorporated consortium called Techteryx bought TrueUSD from Archblock in 2020. In July, TrueUSD said Techteryx will take over its management and all offshore operations. Bluechip noted that \u201cdetails about the company\u2019s ownership and management team have not been disclosed.\u201d Justin Sun, who was mentioned in a lawsuit last year as a potential buyer of TrueUSD around the time of the 2020 purchase, has repeatedly denied any involvement with TrueUSD or Techteryx. Sun told DL News last year: \u201cThe lawsuit has nothing to do with me,\u201d and emphasised that the legal action involves a former employee of Archblock, not Sun himself or his blockchain company, Tron. Stablecoins have recently come under fire, especially the popular USDT coin issued by Tether. The United Nations said the stablecoin plays a major role in money laundering for organised crime groups across Southeast Asia. Tether has pushed back against the 106-page UN report.

                "headline": "Stablecoin FDUSD crosses $1bn mark as Binance launches zero-fee trading",
                "keypoints": "FDUSD has crossed $1 billion in total value in circulation.\nBinance has pushed the stablecoin as an alternative to BUSD.\nFDUSD is the sixth-biggest stablecoin.",
                "body": " FDUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Hong Kong-based finance outfit First Digital Limited, has exceeded $1 billion in value in circulation for the first time. The milestone comes after a Binance campaign encouraging users to swap the exchange\u2019s BUSD stablecoin for other stablecoins. Binance has told users that they can convert BUSD to FDUSD for free on the exchange. To further encourage FDUSD adoption, Binance launched zero-fee trading for six FDUSD trading pairs on Monday. Exchange users can now trade between First Digital\u2019s stablecoin and six other crypto assets: BNB, Dogecoin, Ether, Chainlink, Solana, and Ripple. They can trade in both spot and margin trading markets and pay no fees. The exchange also offers users a 10% annualised yield on FDUSD deposits. Binance has gradually withdrawn support for BUSD after the New York Department of Financial Services ordered BUSD issuer Paxos to stop minting the tokens in February. BUSD holders have until a February deadline to exchange their stablecoins. After that date, Paxos may no longer honour redemptions. In addition to problems with the NYDFS, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has also threatened to sue Paxos on the grounds that BUSD is an illegal securities offering. Before its regulatory problems, BUSD was the third-biggest stablecoin. Its circulation reached a peak value of over $23 billion in November last year, but has since dropped to just $1.6 billion. Despite its regulatory woes, BUSD is the highest-rated stablecoin along with Liquity\u2019s LUSD, according to Bluechip, a non-profit agency that rates stablecoins. BUSD received an A grade, the second-highest grade, and is described as \u201cone of the safest stablecoins to hold.\u201d Bluechip based its rating for BUSD on the fact that it is issued by Paxos, a New York-regulated entity, among other factors. Conversely, FDUSD only received a C rating as it is not issued by a regulated entity. Bluechip also said that the reserve backing for FDUSD was not \u201cbankruptcy remote,\u201d meaning that if First Digital were to declare bankruptcy, FDUSD could lose its backing. Tether, the largest stablecoin with a $89 billion market capitalisation, received a D rating from Bluechip. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.
