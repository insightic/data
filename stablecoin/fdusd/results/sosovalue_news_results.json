This marks a significant increase of 42.6% compared to the previous month, highlighting the growing importance of FDUSD in the crypto trading landscape. The increase in FDUSD trading volume is attributed to Binance's decision to discontinue support for BUSD, encouraging users to switch to FDUSD. Introduced by FD121, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based custody and trust company First Digital, FDUSD was launched in June 2023 and listed on Binance a month later with zero trading fees. This significant increase in trading volume indicates that stablecoins, especially those with favorable trading conditions and solid utility, are increasingly preferred in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

The expansion to Sui follows the launch of FDUSD on Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB).

FDUSD, backed by US Treasury bills and bank deposits, has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.3 billion. The token's growth was significantly boosted by Binance's trading promotion following the shutdown of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin by New York State regulators. Sui, developed by the team behind Meta's closed Diem crypto project, has seen rapid growth in DeFi activities, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing to nearly $700 million.

Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, stated in an interview that the expansion aims to increase the adoption of FDUSD in the decentralized finance (DeFi) field. The growth of the Sui network in the past year has been significant, and FDUSD aims to grow alongside it as the new stablecoin of the network. FDUSD was launched last year and has reached a market value of US$3.3 billion since its launch, making it the fourth largest stablecoin in terms of market value after USDT, USDC, and DAI.",

This move by First Digital Trust, the Hong Kong-based issuer of FDUSD, aims to increase the stablecoin's usage among decentralized finance (DeFi) users. The expansion to Sui follows the launch of FDUSD on Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB). Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital Trust, highlighted Sui's promising growth and support for the DeFi space as key reasons for this decision. FDUSD, backed by US Treasury bills and bank deposits, has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.3 billion. The token's growth was significantly boosted by Binance's trading promotion following the shutdown of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin by New York State regulators. Sui, developed by the team behind Meta's closed Diem crypto project, has seen rapid growth in DeFi activities, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing to nearly $700 million. The expansion makes FDUSD the first top-tier stablecoin issued locally on the Sui network.",

This move by First Digital Trust, the Hong Kong-based issuer of FDUSD, aims to increase the stablecoin's usage among decentralized finance (DeFi) users. The expansion to Sui follows the launch of FDUSD on Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB). Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital Trust, highlighted Sui's promising growth and support for the DeFi space as key reasons for this decision. FDUSD, backed by US Treasury bills and bank deposits, has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.3 billion. The token's growth was significantly boosted by Binance's trading promotion following the shutdown of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin by New York State regulators. Sui, developed by the team behind Meta's closed Diem crypto project, has seen rapid growth in DeFi activities, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing to nearly $700 million. The expansion makes FDUSD the first top-tier stablecoin issued locally on the Sui network.",

The expansion to Sui follows the launch of FDUSD on Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB).

This move by First Digital Trust, the Hong Kong-based issuer of FDUSD, aims to increase the stablecoin's usage among decentralized finance (DeFi) users. The expansion to Sui follows the launch of FDUSD on Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain (BNB). Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital Trust, highlighted Sui's promising growth and support for the DeFi space as key reasons for this decision. FDUSD, backed by US Treasury bills and bank deposits, has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.3 billion. The token's growth was significantly boosted by Binance's trading promotion following the shutdown of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin by New York State regulators. Sui, developed by the team behind Meta's closed Diem crypto project, has seen rapid growth in DeFi activities, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing to nearly $700 million. The expansion makes FDUSD the first top-tier stablecoin issued locally on the Sui network.",
