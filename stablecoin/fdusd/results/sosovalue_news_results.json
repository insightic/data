This marks a significant increase of 42.6% compared to the previous month, highlighting the growing importance of FDUSD in the crypto trading landscape. The increase in FDUSD trading volume is attributed to Binance's decision to discontinue support for BUSD, encouraging users to switch to FDUSD. Introduced by FD121, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based custody and trust company First Digital, FDUSD was launched in June 2023 and listed on Binance a month later with zero trading fees. This significant increase in trading volume indicates that stablecoins, especially those with favorable trading conditions and solid utility, are increasingly preferred in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",
