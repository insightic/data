The review utilized tools like Slither and Echidna to analyze the codebase and smart contract invariants. The most critical findings relate to the supply controller's ability to mint and burn tokens during a pause and the potential for front-running the initialize() function. Additionally, the initializeDomainSeparator() function could disrupt ownership transfers, and there are concerns about Solidity compiler optimizations. To enhance security, addressing these identified issues and optimizing compiler settings could be beneficial.",
