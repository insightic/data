The audit involved a static code analysis to detect known issues, followed by manual verification to confirm or reject the findings. Key vulnerabilities and their statuses were categorized, and a detailed fix log was maintained to track resolutions. Potential improvements could involve implementing additional dynamic analysis and continuous monitoring to complement the static analysis and manual review process.",
