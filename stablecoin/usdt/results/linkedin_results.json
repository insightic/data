It also references a severity level for issues and best practices for source code review.\n\nThe most pressing issues identified include critical severity problems that require immediate attention and vulnerabilities in the economic model that allow for user exploitation. There is also a concern about the potential for gaming the trading environment, which could harm ordinary users.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, it is essential to address the critical severity problems swiftly and to revise the economic model to close loopholes that allow for exploitation. Implementing industry and academic best practices for code maintainability and security can significantly enhance the system's robustness.",
