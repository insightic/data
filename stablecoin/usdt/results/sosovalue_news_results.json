                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

BlockBeats reported on March 4 that Tether, the issuer of the USD stablecoin, announced the launch of an official recovery tool. The tool ensures the transfer of USDT assets in the event of a blockchain interruption. Tether will release an official recovery tool that allows for the migration of USDT between blockchains. Users will be able to verify ownership of their address on an unresponsive blockchain and ownership of the recipient address on another supported blockchain, and Tether will transfer the USDT between them. Affected users can choose to initiate the migration process through a user-friendly interface, which can be accessed via web or command-line tools. This process involves encrypting and signing the migration request to verify ownership of Tether tokens. This process supports popular browser extension wallets and hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor. In addition, the command-line interface allows users to directly input their private keys, enabling them to sign necessary messages using open-source scripts on their local computer.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

Users will be able to verify ownership of their address on an unresponsive blockchain and ownership of the recipient address on another supported blockchain, and Tether will transfer the USDT between them. Affected users can choose to initiate the migration process through a user-friendly interface, which can be accessed via web or command-line tools. This process involves encrypting and signing the migration request to verify ownership of Tether tokens. This process supports popular browser extension wallets and hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination.

Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years.

The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

Celo has established partnerships with more than 1,000 partners in 150 countries, including the Opera MiniPay ultra-light stablecoin wallet in countries such as Kenya and Ghana. Users of this wallet in Africa recently exceeded 2 million. Celo core contributor cLabs also outlined a proposal in a community forum post to make USDT the official gas fee currency, further streamlining the transaction process.\n\nAdditionally, the following ecosystem partners have committed to leveraging native USDT on Celo upon launch: Ammer Pay, Bitmama, Ethichub, Fonbnk, Halofi, Huma Finance, ImpactMarket, Jia, JumpTask, Kotani Pay, Mento, Paychant, Quipu, Ramp Network, Toucan, Untangled Finance, Valora, and Yellow Card, among others.",

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed massive price volatility over the last few days. However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. If the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets. Due to this massive decline in the price of ETH over the last few days, the MVRV ratio for ETH fell considerably. This indicated that the most holders not profitable at the time of writing. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at had grown by 11.79% as well during this period.",

However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. If the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets.

Tron accounted for 45% of illegal transaction volume in 2023, surpassing Ethereum and Bitcoin. The network's low gas fees and minimal price fluctuations have made it a favorite among cybercriminals, leading to increased scrutiny from regulators.",

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days. This could be a sign that new addresses have lost interest in the TON token.Read TONcoin\u2019s [TON] price prediction 2024-25If new addresses continue to not show interest in TON, the price could fall further in the future.",

According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time.

Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage.

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days. This could be a sign that new addresses have lost interest in the TON token.Read TONcoin\u2019s [TON] price prediction 2024-25If new addresses continue to not show interest in TON, the price could fall further in the future.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days.

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days. This could be a sign that new addresses have lost interest in the TON token.Read TONcoin\u2019s [TON] price prediction 2024-25If new addresses continue to not show interest in TON, the price could fall further in the future.",

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed massive price volatility over the last few days. However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. If the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets. Due to this massive decline in the price of ETH over the last few days, the MVRV ratio for ETH fell considerably. This indicated that the most holders not profitable at the time of writing. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at had grown by 11.79% as well during this period.",

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance.

This move comes after the Biden administration reintroduced sanctions on Venezuela for failing to progress towards a competitive presidential election in 2024. The adoption of cryptocurrency, particularly USDT, is part of Venezuela's broader strategy to mitigate the impact of economic sanctions and instability, following the unsuccessful launch of its own crypto, the Petro. Cryptocurrency usage in Venezuela is also driven by the country's economic instability and hyperinflation, with many citizens turning to digital currencies like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.",

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green.

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance.

MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days.

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance.

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately. At press time, TON was trading at $6.16, with its price down by 10.79% over the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the network growth for TON also declined over the last few days.

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance.

The adoption of cryptocurrency, particularly USDT, is part of Venezuela's broader strategy to mitigate the impact of economic sanctions and instability, following the unsuccessful launch of its own crypto, the Petro. Cryptocurrency usage in Venezuela is also driven by the country's economic instability and hyperinflation, with many citizens turning to digital currencies like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

Telegram Wallet is in the news today after it announced that it won\u2019t charge any fees for taking out USDT to other wallets on the TONcoin [TON] network until the end of June. The TON Foundation is putting up 11 million TONcoin to encourage people to use USDT on TON.However, here it\u2019s important to note that USDT on TON is not currently available to users in the United States. There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance.

PDVSA has shifted its oil trades to USDT, especially for spot transactions requiring prepayment, to avoid the risk of overseas bank accounts being frozen. This move comes after the Biden administration reintroduced sanctions on Venezuela for failing to progress towards a competitive presidential election in 2024. The adoption of cryptocurrency, particularly USDT, is part of Venezuela's broader strategy to mitigate the impact of economic sanctions and instability, following the unsuccessful launch of its own crypto, the Petro. Cryptocurrency usage in Venezuela is also driven by the country's economic instability and hyperinflation, with many citizens turning to digital currencies like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth.",

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed massive price volatility over the last few days. However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. If the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets. Due to this massive decline in the price of ETH over the last few days, the MVRV ratio for ETH fell considerably. This indicated that the most holders not profitable at the time of writing.

With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

This move expands Tether's presence across the crypto sphere, bringing its coverage to over a dozen blockchains. The integration aims to provide TON and Telegram's 900 million user base with a borderless experience for peer-to-peer payments and seamless value transfers between the ecosystem and other blockchains. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino expressed support for TON's vision of an open and decentralized internet and a borderless financial system. The launch is expected to boost TON's activity and liquidity, facilitating developers' access to capital across various use cases. Following this integration, USDT is now live on 15 blockchains. This development comes shortly after USDT launched on the carbon-negative Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Celo network. USDT recently crossed the $100 billion market cap milestone, with the figure now at $109 billion. Additionally, Tether has expanded its business beyond stablecoins, venturing into bitcoin mining, P2P communication platforms, artificial intelligence, and digital skills education.",

Significant volumes of USDT were moved from Tether\u2019s reserves to exchanges within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed massive price volatility over the last few days. However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network. This outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time. To meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum. Tether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage. While Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes. At press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly. This suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage. On the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role. Even though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours. If the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets. Due to this massive decline in the price of ETH over the last few days, the MVRV ratio for ETH fell considerably. This indicated that the most holders not profitable at the time of writing. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at had grown by 11.79% as well during this period.",

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well.

Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base.

Announced at the Token2049 event in Dubai, this move by Tether Operations aims to strengthen ties with Telegram's Web3 ecosystem by launching its stablecoins, including the U.S. dollar-pegged Tether (USDT) and the gold-pegged Tether Gold (XAUT), on the Open Network (TON). This development is part of Tether's expansion across multiple blockchains, now totaling 15, and marks a significant milestone for the TON network, which recently overtook Dogecoin as the ninth-largest blockchain by market value. The launch is expected to enhance liquidity, increase activity, and offer a seamless financial experience akin to traditional systems. Additionally, Tether announced restructuring and introduced four new business divisions: Tether Data, Tether Finance, Tether Power, and Tether Edu. The integration with TON also promises a borderless payment experience for Telegram's user base, estimated at over 900 million globally, leveraging the TON ecosystem's capabilities for fiat and crypto transfers.",

                "body": "The United States Justice Department has charged Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, a descendant of Louis Cartier, with collaborating with a Colombian drug cartel and laundering drug money using USDT. Maximilien was arrested along with five Colombian nationals as he attempted to import 100 kg of cocaine and launder hundreds of millions of dollars. Using USDT to launder drug money, law enforcement arrested Maximilien and five others after they had laundered over 14.5 million USDT, primarily through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Cartier is currently in custody in Miami, while his associates are being held in Colombian prisons. According to the authorities, Cartier, along with Leonardo de Jesus Zuluage Duque, Erica Milena Lopez Ortiz, and Felipe Estrada Echeverry, were members of a drug network that laundered millions worth of drug money using crypto. Cartier is also alleged to have made a series of financial offenses, resulting in millions of unlawful transactions. The money laundering network Cartier assumed control of several shell companies to carry out his money laundering scheme. He also misrepresented the function of these shell companies to financial institutions, stating they were in the business of software and technology. According to the Department of Justice indictment, the accounts of these shell companies were then used as unlicensed money transmitters. According to the DOJ, Cartier has been a member of the money laundering network since 2020 and operated an unlicensed OTC exchange. Cartier\u2019s companies included Bullpix Solutions LLC, Vintech Capital LLC, VC Innovated Technologies LLC, AZ Technologies LLC, Softmill LLC, and Sun Technologies LLC. From 2020 to the present, Cartier\u2019s unlicensed money-transmitting business laundered millions in illegal transactions and criminal proceeds. The jewelry heir now faces four counts of criminal misconduct, including money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, transacting in property derived from specified unlawful activities, and operating an unlicensed money remitter. The use of USDT for money laundering is not surprising as it substitutes directly for dollars. However, unlike bank transfers, USDT can be sent permissionlessly to any user on 16 supported blockchains in seconds. For drug cartels, USDT\u2019s instant and irreversible settlements are quite convenient. USDT\u2019s parent company, Tether, has repeatedly stated that it is working to reduce the use of USDT in criminal and illegal activities.

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month.

                    "body": "The United States Justice Department has charged Maximilien de Hoop Cartier, a descendant of Louis Cartier, with collaborating with a Colombian drug cartel and laundering drug money using USDT. Maximilien was arrested along with five Colombian nationals as he attempted to import 100 kg of cocaine and launder hundreds of millions of dollars. Using USDT to launder drug money, law enforcement arrested Maximilien and five others after they had laundered over 14.5 million USDT, primarily through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Cartier is currently in custody in Miami, while his associates are being held in Colombian prisons. According to the authorities, Cartier, along with Leonardo de Jesus Zuluage Duque, Erica Milena Lopez Ortiz, and Felipe Estrada Echeverry, were members of a drug network that laundered millions worth of drug money using crypto. Cartier is also alleged to have made a series of financial offenses, resulting in millions of unlawful transactions. The money laundering network Cartier assumed control of several shell companies to carry out his money laundering scheme. He also misrepresented the function of these shell companies to financial institutions, stating they were in the business of software and technology. According to the Department of Justice indictment, the accounts of these shell companies were then used as unlicensed money transmitters. According to the DOJ, Cartier has been a member of the money laundering network since 2020 and operated an unlicensed OTC exchange. Cartier\u2019s companies included Bullpix Solutions LLC, Vintech Capital LLC, VC Innovated Technologies LLC, AZ Technologies LLC, Softmill LLC, and Sun Technologies LLC. From 2020 to the present, Cartier\u2019s unlicensed money-transmitting business laundered millions in illegal transactions and criminal proceeds. The jewelry heir now faces four counts of criminal misconduct, including money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, transacting in property derived from specified unlawful activities, and operating an unlicensed money remitter. The use of USDT for money laundering is not surprising as it substitutes directly for dollars. However, unlike bank transfers, USDT can be sent permissionlessly to any user on 16 supported blockchains in seconds. For drug cartels, USDT\u2019s instant and irreversible settlements are quite convenient. USDT\u2019s parent company, Tether, has repeatedly stated that it is working to reduce the use of USDT in criminal and illegal activities.

The report suggests that regulatory clarity in the US could encourage traditional banks to enter the stablecoin market, potentially reducing the dominance of current leaders like Tether's USDT. The Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, could change the landscape by giving banks a competitive edge and limiting non-banking institutions to a maximum issuance of $10 billion. With Tether's USDT being the third largest cryptocurrency with a market value of $110 billion, and Circle's USDC following with $34 billion, the introduction of this bill could significantly impact the stablecoin market. Analyst Andrew O'Neill highlighted that the bill's approval could accelerate blockchain innovation for enterprises, especially in tokenization and digital bond issuances. This could create opportunities for stablecoin-issuing banks and reduce Tether's market dominance. The report also noted that USDT, issued by a non-U.S. entity, would not be a permitted payment stablecoin under the proposed bill, potentially reducing its demand.",

                    "body": "Learn how to easily transfer USDT to your MetaMask wallet and start using it on various decentralized applications (DApps). MetaMask is among the most popular cryptocurrency wallets globally, known for its ease of use and robust security features. Functioning primarily as a browser extension and a mobile app, MetaMask provides a gateway for users to interact with Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem and other compatible networks. It facilitates seamless access to decentralized applications (DApps), token swaps, and the broader Web3 environment. Tether (USDT), on the other hand, is a cornerstone of the stablecoin market. Its role in the crypto market is pivotal; it aims to provide a stable digital asset pegged to the United States dollar. As a bridge between fiat and cryptocurrencies, USDT enables faster, less expensive transactions than traditional banking systems, and its integration into MetaMask opens up a wide range of opportunities for users to leverage its stability within their digital asset portfolios. This article provides an overview of certain requirements before moving USDT to MetaMask, the procedure of adding USDT to MetaMask, receiving USDT in MetaMask, tracking USDT transactions on MetaMask, and troubleshooting common issues with USDT in MetaMask. Before adding USDT to the MetaMask wallet, there are a few prerequisites: The first step is to install MetaMask, which is available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Brave and as a mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. One can download it from the official MetaMask website or the respective app stores. The setup process involves installing the application and creating a wallet. After installing MetaMask, a strong password needs to be set. Additionally, during the setup process, MetaMask will generate a secret recovery phrase. One needs to securely write down and store this phrase in a safe location. This recovery phrase is essential, as it is the sole method to regain access to the wallet in case the password is forgotten or access to the device is lost. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is required to pay for transaction fees, commonly referred to as \u201cgas.\u201d Before adding USDT, one must ensure the MetaMask wallet has some ETH available to cover the fee. Users may purchase ETH on an exchange and subsequently transfer it to the MetaMask wallet address. Adding Tether (USDT) to the MetaMask wallet involves the following steps: MetaMask supports layer-1 blockchains such as Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain, and layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Polygon. For this guide, the Ethereum network (the default network for the MetaMask wallet) is used for illustration purposes. Navigate to the \u201cTokens\u201d section located on the main dashboard at the screen\u2019s bottom. It displays the list of all cryptocurrencies the user currently holds. Scroll down in the \u201cToken\u201d tab and click on \u201cAdd Token.\u201d You will be directed to a search interface. If USDT doesn\u2019t automatically appear in the search, you will need to manually add it by entering the contract address, symbol (USDT), and decimals. Fill out the form and click \u201cNext\u201d to complete the process. MetaMask will ask for confirmation. Once you confirm, the USDT token will be added to the wallet. MetaMask keeps a detailed record of all transactions, which one may view by clicking on the \u201cActivity\u201d tab within your wallet. Each entry in the transaction history displays the amount of USDT transferred, the date of the transaction, the transaction fee (in ETH), and the addresses involved. USDT balances are visible in the \u201cAssets\u201d tab of the MetaMask wallet. It updates in real-time as transactions are processed on the blockchain. While MetaMask does not natively support alerts, one can use external services such as Etherscan by registering their wallet address there to receive notifications on USDT transactions. Users may occasionally encounter issues with USDT in their MetaMask wallets. Here are solutions to some common problems: If USDT does not appear after adding, one should verify that the correct USDT contract address has been entered. Any error in the address can prevent the token from showing up in the wallet. Sometimes, a simple refresh of the wallet interface can help. This can be done by logging out and logging back into MetaMask or refreshing the browser. Additionally, if automated detection fails, one can manually add USDT by selecting \u201cAdd Token,\u201d choosing \u201cCustom Token,\u201d and entering the contract address and token symbol (USDT). High traffic on the Ethereum network may lead to delayed or failed transactions. In such a case, users could check Etherscan to see current network conditions. Insufficient gas fees can also cause transactions to fail. Users could resolve this by increasing the gas fee. One may also use a blockchain explorer to check the status of transactions using the wallet address. This would confirm whether the transaction has indeed failed or if there is just a delay in displaying the updated balance in MetaMask. MetaMask has a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting section that offers guidance on common issues. Additionally, the wallet has a strong community presence on platforms such as Reddit and Discord, where experienced users can offer assistance and advice. If the issue remains unresolved, one can submit a support ticket through MetaMask\u2019s help portal.",

There might be regulatory reasons behind this limitation.New changes on TONThis could significantly increase USDT circulation and use on TON, making it a more attractive platform for USDT transactions. With more users and transactions, TON could see a hike in overall network activity. This could translate to potentially more transaction fees which can fuel TON\u2019s security and development in the future.In terms of overall activity, it can be seen that the number of daily active users on the network grew by 19.6% over the past month. Moreover, the revenue generated by TON also appreciated by 266.3% during this period as well. If the USDT incentive system for TON goes well, it may aid the network in generating even more revenue and keep it on a positive trajectory.Additionally, according to Token Terminal\u2019s data, the number of core developers on the network hiked by 22% in the last 24 hours. Also, the number of code commits surged by a massive 179% too.More developers can fuel a wider range of applications and features on TON, enriching the overall user experience and attracting a larger user base. As developers build more on TON, the network can benefit from their code and functionalities, potentially leading to improved scalability and transaction processing capabilities.How is TON doing?Despite these positive updates on the network, TON has been seeing red lately.

                    "body": "Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin USDT with a market value of $108 billion, has expanded its services on the Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform closely related to the messaging app Telegram. The TON altcoin has a market value of $21.7 billion. The announcement was made during the Dubai 2049 conference, revealing that Tether had authorized $10 million worth of USDT in TON, of which $3 million had already been issued. This move is expected to enhance peer-to-peer payments for Telegram's large user base of approximately 900 million and encourage activity in the TON ecosystem. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that the launch of USDT and XAUT on TON will facilitate seamless value transfer, increase activity and liquidity, and provide a financial experience comparable to traditional financial systems. XAUT is a gold-indexed cryptocurrency belonging to Tether. TON, originally launched by Telegram but now operates independently due to past regulatory hurdles, has seen its usage increase recently, with the number of monthly active addresses increasing from under 100,000 to over 1.7 million in just six months. Halil Mirakhmed, business manager of Wallet in Telegram, explained that transaction fees in the ecosystem have been reduced to increase the adoption of TON. He added that USDT on the TON network is the only option that simplifies the user experience for those involved in the TON ecosystem.",
