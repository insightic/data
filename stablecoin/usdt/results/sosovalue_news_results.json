                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

BlockBeats reported on March 4 that Tether, the issuer of the USD stablecoin, announced the launch of an official recovery tool. The tool ensures the transfer of USDT assets in the event of a blockchain interruption. Tether will release an official recovery tool that allows for the migration of USDT between blockchains. Users will be able to verify ownership of their address on an unresponsive blockchain and ownership of the recipient address on another supported blockchain, and Tether will transfer the USDT between them. Affected users can choose to initiate the migration process through a user-friendly interface, which can be accessed via web or command-line tools. This process involves encrypting and signing the migration request to verify ownership of Tether tokens. This process supports popular browser extension wallets and hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor. In addition, the command-line interface allows users to directly input their private keys, enabling them to sign necessary messages using open-source scripts on their local computer.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

Users will be able to verify ownership of their address on an unresponsive blockchain and ownership of the recipient address on another supported blockchain, and Tether will transfer the USDT between them. Affected users can choose to initiate the migration process through a user-friendly interface, which can be accessed via web or command-line tools. This process involves encrypting and signing the migration request to verify ownership of Tether tokens. This process supports popular browser extension wallets and hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

In the latest development, $3 billion worth of USDT tokens were mined by the Tether Treasury within a period of three days, according to an update by Lookonchain. The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination. Since April 1st, approximately $2.55 billion USDT has flowed into prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Coinbase. Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years. With the widespread rebound in digital assets price this year, USDT surpassed $100 billion in market cap as it continued to command the lion\u2019s share of the stablecoin market. The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin. Tether also announced completing the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 audit, which is deemed as the first step towards achieving the highest level of security compliance.",

A message shared by X user @MartyPartyMusic showed a screenshot of a customer support message which appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. The message indicated that moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading on the platform in the EU area. Over 30 new EUR spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. The exact reason for the reported delistings remains unclear, with neither OKX nor Tether responding to requests for further information. Speculation on social media suggests the delisting may be related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulatory framework. EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14, indicating a push for further legislation. The EU's MICA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, with stablecoin rules slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.",

                    "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

The tokens were then distributed across the Ethereum and Tron blockchains. This surge in USDT minting has sparked curiosity regarding the destination.

Notably, Bitfinex received $1.018 billion USDT, while Kraken and Binance witnessed an inflow of $824.1 million and $614.6 million worth of the largest stablecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase received $93.8 million USDT during the same period. These USDT inflows raised questions among the community about whether investors who were sitting on the sidelines for now are preparing to enter the market. Prices have been falling recently, which provides a good buy-the-dip opportunity. Tether has seen a monumental surge in its dominance over the past years.

The latest development comes days after the stablecoins issuer expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the acquisition of 8,889 BTC, valued at approximately $627 million. This purchase boosted Tether\u2019s Bitcoin reserves, bringing them to a total of 75,354 BTC. This move was part of its broader plan to allocate up to 15% of corporate profits from surplus USDT stablecoin reserves into Bitcoin.

                "body": "A cryptocurrency user accidentally sent 1.36 million Tether (USDT) directly to the USDT token's smart contract address on Ethereum. This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds. However, as of now, there is no record of the lost funds being mined again by Tether.",

This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.
