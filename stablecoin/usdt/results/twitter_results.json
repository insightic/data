The most critical issues found were related to vulnerabilities in the smart contract code, which could potentially be exploited if not addressed. Additionally, the report likely includes a detailed fix log, indicating the team's response to the identified issues. For potential improvement, the report may suggest enhancing security measures and conducting regular code audits to prevent future vulnerabilities.",
