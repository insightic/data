This incident is particularly notable because the user had made a test transaction of 100 USDT just before the mishap. Typically, tokens sent directly to a smart contract address where the tools to perform such transfers do not exist are considered irreversibly lost. This is because token contracts generally lack sweeping. As expected, the USDT token contract does not have such a function. However, the USDT token contract includes a destroyBlackFunds function. This function acts as a safeguard that allows the owner of the contract to remove certain USDTs from circulation at any blacklisted address. While blacklisting is a security measure that prevents certain addresses from sending USDT, these addresses can still receive USDT. Interestingly, the USDT contract address itself is marked as blacklisted. Realizing the mistake, the user shared the incident on Twitter. Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to the situation and stated that there may be a way to solve this problem. When the data is examined, it appears that the USDT contract address is performing a transaction using the destroyBlackFunds function. This shows that Ardoino is taking action to recover the funds.

This action reflects the growing demand for USDT in the cryptocurrency market. Despite this, Bitcoin's price has shown signs of stagnation, facing resistance at the $53,000 mark, which has historically been a critical point for its price movements.

Deltec's lawyer, Desiree Moore, stated that Deltec and its chairman were unaware of FTX's misconduct before it was made public, and that the allegations rely largely on unverified statements by individuals settling with the plaintiffs in exchange for information.
