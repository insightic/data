                "headline": "Stablecoin supply jumps to $146bn, biggest since FTX collapse",
                "keypoints": "The stablecoin market capitalisation rebounded to $146 billion, marking a $20 billion increase since August.\nTether's USDT led the growth, surpassing $100 billion in supply.\nNew stablecoins like Ethena's USDe and Curve's crvUSD have emerged, offering high yields and innovative features.",
                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "headline": "Binance financial crime head held in a \u2018guest house\u2019 in Nigeria for two weeks",
                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Nigerians can no longer trade crypto for naira on Binance.\nThe crypto exchange has come under scrutiny from multiple Nigerian authorities in last month.",
                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Nigeria probes Binance for facilitating terror finance and money laundering as two executives remain detained",
                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "keypoints": "JPMorgan warned clients against risks of using the Tether stablecoin, again.\nThe investment bank addressed client questions following a note from early February that accused Tether of a lack of transparency and regulatory compliance.\nTether slammed the note as \u201chypocritical\u201d in comments to DL News.",
                "body": " JPMorgan\u2019s clients have burning questions about Tether. The investment bank addressed clients\u2019 inquiries in a critical note on Thursday. Specifically, who uses it, the regulatory risks associated with it, and what impending regulation means for the multi-billion dollar stablecoin. Tether rejected the criticism, labelling it as \u201chypocritical\u201d in messages to DL News. Tether is at risk from regulatory changes, both domestically and abroad, according to JPMorgan. Clients raised several questions after JPMorgan\u2019s earlier February note cited alleged systemic risks related to Tether\u2019s stablecoin \u2014 namely that Tether\u2019s growing dominance was bad for both the crypto and stablecoin markets. \u201cWho uses Tether? The Tether user base looks rather diverse across both centralised and decentralised space,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote, addressing client inquiries. That includes entities operating both within and outside the US, the investment bank said. Much of Tether\u2019s user base \u201cresides offshore in less stringent regulation jurisdictions beyond the direct reach of US regulators,\u201d the bank said. The investment bank cited a recent United Nation\u2019s report that \u201csuggests USDT has become a prominent payment method for money laundering and scams in Southeast Asia.\u201d Tether kicked back at JPMorgan\u2019s latest report. Tether is \u201cproud\u201d of its collaboration with law enforcement, particularly in the US, to curb the illicit use of stablecoins, the stablecoin issuer told DL News via email. \u201cThese hypocritical attacks from the world\u2019s biggest bank suggest JPMorgan\u2019s jealousy over missing the boat on Bitcoin and stablecoins,\u201d Tether said. \u201cPerhaps instead of obsessing over Tether\u2019s market dominance, JPMorgan could address their own practices that have led to them paying nearly $40 billion in fines for banking, securities and other violations.\u201d Tether cited a violation tracker that claims JPMorgan has been fined a total of $39.34 billion on 275 separate occasions between 2000 and 2024, when asked to clarify its remarks by DL News. JPMorgan declined to respond to Tether\u2019s comment. New regulations and the ability to sanction Tether\u2019s offshore usage were also at the top of clients\u2019 minds. \u201cCan US regulators exert control on Tether\u2019s offshore usage?,\u201d clients of JPMorgan asked. \u201cUS regulators can exert some control on Tether\u2019s offshore usage via OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control), which applies to foreign entities whose activities are related to the US financial system,\u201d JPMorgan said. Tether\u2019s association with the crypto mixer Tornado Cash \u2014 which OFAC sanctioned in August 2022 \u2014 is an example of how US authorities can exert some control over the stablecoin, according to JPMorgan analysts. Tornado Cash allows users to obscure transactions. The use of Tether via this privacy enhancement tool has \u201creportedly enabled users to anonymise their transactions for illicit activity,\u201d the bank said. \u201cWhile direct legal actions against offshore entities and decentralised firms are complex, indirect measures and international cooperation could potentially hinder the usage of Tether,\u201d JPMorgan said. Stablecoin regulations are an example of this, the bank added. Regulations are planned to be \u201ccoordinated globally via the Financial Stability Board (FSB) across the G20, further constraining the usage of unregulated stablecoins such as Tether,\u201d JPMorgan wrote. Regulations in the US and in Europe, slated for later this year, will address concerns over issuers, reserves, liquidity and stability, the investment bank said. \u201cUpcoming stablecoin regulations would likely put indirect pressure on Tether as its attractiveness would diminish relative to stablecoins with more transparency and greater compliance,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote. The bank\u2019s analysis comes amid heightened scrutiny in recent months of stablecoins, particularly regarding their role in money laundering, terror financing and regulatory compliance.

Crypto derivatives exchanges Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in an earlier $6 million round led by Dragonfly and Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto exchange BitMEX. Select investors have been able to mint USDe since December. Beginning today, any investor outside the US, Russia, and more than two dozen smaller countries will be able to mint the stablecoin. USDe will try to break into a highly competitive \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 field. Stablecoins are among the most popular real-world applications of crypto technology. They have also been a cash cow for issuers like Tether, who\u2019ve backed their tokens with US Treasuries. Tether posted a net operating profit of more than $6 billion in 2023. Ethena founder Guy Young doesn\u2019t expect USDe to leapfrog Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which have a combined market capitalisation of just under $125 billion. The goal is to create a mass-market stablecoin backed by Ether and versions of staked Ether, rather than real-world assets such as cash and US Treasuries. \u201cWe are definitely not as decentralised as stuff like Liquity,\u201d Young told DL News. \u201c[We\u2019re] not trying to create something that\u2019s perfectly decentralised. What you\u2019re trying to do is just remove collateral from the US banking system and put it into the crypto ecosystem.\u201d Liquity is the company behind the LUSD stablecoin. USDe\u2019s mass-market launch will include integrations with DeFi protocols such as Synthetix, Curve, Convex, and Aave. Other stablecoins, like LUSD and RAI, only accept Ether as collateral. And forthcoming versions of both will accept Ether derivatives like Lido\u2019s stETH. To protect against the volatility of Ether and hold their pegs, existing Ether-backed stablecoins require over-collateralisation: For every $1 of the stablecoin a user borrows, they must deposit more than $1 in Ether. That limits how much a user can borrow and how big the stablecoin can grow. Using a complicated trading strategy, Ethena lets users mint $1 in USDe for about $1.05 worth of Ether. \u2018We basically want to be within the top three stablecoins\u2019 This should create a stablecoin that can expand to a market capitalisation of $5 billion to $10 billion \u2014 much larger than existing Ether-backed competitors, according to Young. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to get as big as something like USDC or USDT, just because there\u2019s natural constraints around how big this product can get, because it relies on the derivative market within crypto being a certain size.\u201d At the same time, it should provide a more decentralised alternative to USDC and USDT, which rely on assets held at banks, which are subject to government oversight and regulation \u2014 in other words, the institutions to which crypto was meant to provide an alternative. \u201cStablecoins are the most important instrument across the entire space,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete joke that DeFi runs literally 100% on centralised stablecoins.\u201d Unlike LUSD or RAI, however, it will rely on old-fashioned businesses for certain functions. Custodians with experience managing crypto, such as Fireblocks and BitGo, have been tapped to hold customer deposits, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s huge centralised components to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Since it became available to some investors in December, USDe\u2019s market capitalisation has topped $225 million, making it one of the 12 largest stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Investors can lock up their USDe to create a yield-bearing token that Ethena has likened to an \u201cinternet bond,\u201d called sUSDe. As of Thursday, the annual yield on sUSDe was a whopping 23%, a figure that recalls the heady days of the Terra stablecoin. Terra imploded in May 2022. Terra\u2019s co-founder, Do Kwon, is currently jailed in Montenegro, awaiting the results of a retrial that could see him extradited to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in those countries want to prosecute him for his role in the collapsed ecosystem. Ethena is not an algorithmic stablecoin like Terra. Some of Ethena\u2019s yield comes from staked Ether. As of Thursday, the yield for staking Ether was just under 4% and is expected to fall as more people stake their Ether. The rest comes from the trading strategy that helps keep USDe at peg: Opening short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely cyclical through the market cycles,\u201d Young said of the yield. At the bottom of a bear market, it would likely be near zero, as in 2022. \u201cAnd then it gets pretty crazy, to 20% to 30% when things are properly heated.\u201d He said that he expects this to remain a competitive advantage over other stablecoins. \u201cThe lesson that we got from Anchor\u2026 was, the demand for $1 which can return higher yield than the rest of the market by a few hundred basis points is not a billion dollars. It\u2019s like 20 [billion],\u201d he said, referring to the Terra-affiliated protocol that generated the failed stablecoin\u2019s now-infamous 20% yield. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much risk was sitting there within Terra and Anchor, $20 billion went in there because there was a slightly higher yield.\u201d Correction: Ethena corrected its announcement to remove Franklin Templeton and PayPal Ventures, which are not participating in the funding round, and to clarify that Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in the company\u2019s previous fund raise. Correction: Ethena also clarified that the Brevan Howard deal has not yet closed. Aleks Gilbert is a New York based reporter covering DeFi. Got a tip? Email him at aleks@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "A new Fidelity report says 2024 could be the year institutions dip their toes in DeFi.\nA combination of rate cuts and increased stablecoin yields in DeFi could be enough to make it worth their while.",
                "body": " A new report from Fidelity says institutions could finally make the leap into DeFi in 2024 as yields start to rise. The report, which covers the asset manager\u2019s 2024 outlook for the crypto industry, focuses on several key areas of development, including Bitcoin mining, stablecoins \u2014 and DeFi. \u201cThere may be renewed interest in 2024 if DeFi yields once again become more attractive than TradFi yields and more developed infrastructure emerges,\u201d the report said. TradFi, or traditional finance, refers to finance beyond crypto \u2014 big banks, asset managers, hedge funds, and so on. The prediction comes as the yields DeFi investors can earn by lending out their stablecoins surpasses the yields on US Treasuries. Fidelity acknowledged that the firm\u2019s 2023 prediction that institutional investors would start meaningfully engaging with DeFi didn\u2019t pan out. It said that in last year\u2019s \u201cprevailing risk-off environment, institutions deemed the mid-single digit returns offered by DeFi yield to be too low for the associated risk.\u201d The report added that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to increase interest rates in 2023 provided institutions with better, or at least perceived to be safer, options. Throughout 2023, dollar-pegged stablecoins took a hit as DeFi investors moved into US Treasuries to earn higher yields. But, if the Fed lowers interest rates by 0.75% by the end of 2024 as forecast, institutions might start looking for more lucrative \u2014 but also riskier \u2014 ways to make more money, like investing in DeFi. The Boston-based financial group, which has $4.5 trillion of assets under management, controls some $4.25 billion worth of Bitcoin through its spot ETF. In DeFi, the yield investors can earn typically increases as the appetite for risk increases. DeFi lending protocols like Aave, the biggest of its kind with over $8.3 billion of deposits, offer an easy way for investors to leverage their crypto holdings. But to do so, other investors must deposit assets \u2014 namely stablecoins \u2014 for them to borrow. In recent months, the yields Aave users can earn by lending out their stablecoins have surpassed the 10-year US Treasuries rate. The 10-year US rate, commonly referred to as the risk-free rate for dollar investments, currently sits at around 4.3%. In DeFi, investors can earn up to 14% on USDT, the biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin in DeFi with over $97 billion in circulation. That\u2019s increased from around 5% in August. Other stablecoins are also commanding higher yields. Dai, the third-biggest stablecoin with around $4.8 billion in circulation, earns Aave depositors around 8.5%, while Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin, earns just under 5%. DeFi investors usually view the lending rates offered on DeFi stablecoins through lending protocols like Aave as the sector\u2019s own risk-free rate. That\u2019s because it represents the baseline return against which all other DeFi positions are evaluated. The rates offered to lenders on Aave are decided by the protocol\u2019s algorithms. Yields increase in line with how popular an asset is with borrowers. It\u2019s high yields like these that could tempt institutions into DeFi if and when the yields on US Treasuries fall. And as long as the appetite for risk continues, the enticing yields that DeFi investors can achieve through lending stablecoins are unlikely to diminish in the near future.

                "headline": "Binance users in the Philipines take 7% haircut on USDT following regulators ban",
                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "headline": "Solana projects set to challenge Circle and Tether dominance in $3 billion stablecoin market",
                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "headline": "Binance financial crime head held in a \u2018guest house\u2019 in Nigeria for two weeks",
                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Nigerians can no longer trade crypto for naira on Binance.\nThe crypto exchange has come under scrutiny from multiple Nigerian authorities in last month.",
                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "keypoints": "The Curve DAO has about $290,000 in unclaimed fees, mostly from the Gnosis Chain.\nThe unclaimed fees, once collected, will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders.\nCurve is expanding its revenue streams with a new lending product and with the growth of its stablecoin crvUSD, alongside its traditional trading volume revenue.",
                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "headline": "Binance users in the Philipines take 7% haircut on USDT following regulator ban",
                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "headline": "Solana projects set to challenge Circle and Tether dominance in $3 billion stablecoin market",
                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "keypoints": "The stablecoin market capitalisation rebounded to $146 billion, marking a $20 billion increase since August.\nTether's USDT led the growth, surpassing $100 billion in supply.\nNew stablecoins like Ethena's USDe and Curve's crvUSD have emerged, offering high yields and innovative features.",
                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "headline": "Circle\u2019s USDC mounts $27bn comeback as analysts expect \u2018resurgence\u2019 to last",
                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "keypoints": "The Curve DAO has about $290,000 in unclaimed fees, mostly from the Gnosis Chain.\nThe unclaimed fees, once collected, will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders.\nCurve is expanding its revenue streams with a new lending product and with the growth of its stablecoin crvUSD, alongside its traditional trading volume revenue.",
                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "headline": "Why $104bn Tether \u2018exists at the pleasure\u2019 of the banking system",
                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Nigeria probes Binance for facilitating terror finance and money laundering as two executives remain detained",
                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "headline": "Missed Ethena\u2019s $500m airdrop? The DeFi project is already planning the next one",
                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why $104bn Tether \u2018exists at the pleasure\u2019 of the banking system",
                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte urges stablecoin users to look beyond circulation.\nCircle took a hit when Silicon Valley Bank failed.\nThe issuer is looking for an edge by embracing regulatory compliance.",
                "body": " Forget market value... for a second. When it comes to stablecoins, there\u2019s another vital factor to consider \u2014 how are people using them? This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s $500m Bitcoin mining push is just about ready as halving looms, CEO Paolo Ardoino says",
                "keypoints": "Stablecoin giant elbowed its way into Bitcoin mining with plants in Latin America.\n'We are first focusing on building renewable energy stations,' Ardoino told DL News.\nTether is taking advantage of concentration of the sector in the US.",
                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "headline": "ZkLink looks to solve Ethereum\u2019s fragmented liquidity with a layer 3 \u2014 but there are risks",
                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "headline": "Binance financial crime head held in a \u2018guest house\u2019 in Nigeria for two weeks",
                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Nigerians can no longer trade crypto for naira on Binance.\nThe crypto exchange has come under scrutiny from multiple Nigerian authorities in last month.",
                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "The ECB said Bitcoin failed to deliver on a number of points.\nPantera countered in a point-by-point rebuttal.\nBitcoin layer protocols could enable digital payments, Pantera says.",
                "body": " Pantera Capital is taking a swing against the European Central Bank\u2019s claims that Bitcoin \u201chas failed to be a global decentralised digital currency.\u201d The $5.2 billion venture capital firm and crypto investing pioneer disagrees with this verdict. \u201cPeople can store their wealth in it with the expectation that it will be worth at least as much if not much more in the future,\u201d Pantera Capital wrote in an article published this week. Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "headline": "Investors funnel $4.2bn into stablecoins in a week as demand heats up",
                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "keypoints": "The stablecoin market capitalisation rebounded to $146 billion, marking a $20 billion increase since August.\nTether's USDT led the growth, surpassing $100 billion in supply.\nNew stablecoins like Ethena's USDe and Curve's crvUSD have emerged, offering high yields and innovative features.",
                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. With $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender, Circle\u2019s stablecoin, USDC, briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": " The halving was baked into Bitcoin\u2019s price long ago. That much we know. Now analysts are growing increasingly anxious that the recent rally \u2014 a most welcome narrative for investors after a long bear market \u2014 will have to overcome a number of challenges to keep going. And the sobering news is that these obstacles have nothing to do with crypto. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what propels us higher near term,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, there\u2019s loads of positivity still fizzing in the market. We now live in a world with 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. A year ago that looked virtually impossible. And Bitcoin is still up 105% in the last 12 months. But the \u201cmonster retail\u201d inflows for those ETFs have dropped in recent weeks. And the \u201chalving will soon be behind us,\u201d which means the key drivers of the recent rally may be \u201cwaning,\u201d Rudick said. The halving will slash the rewards Bitcoin miners get for maintaining the blockchain, reducing the creation of new coins by half, meaning there will be fewer new tokens hitting the market. At the same time, the threat of a regional war in the Middle East is rattling investors. And with US consumer prices not falling as quickly as economists would like, the Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts, which \u201crisk-on\u201d investors in stocks and crypto are counting on for a boost. Rudick also noted that repatriations from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to pay roughly 142,000 Bitcoin to more than 10,000 creditors. That may exacerbate prices as creditors seek the return of their funds either through fiat or cryptocurrencies. Tether is facing pressure from regulators, which could also be a risk, Rudick said. The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation has been under fire this year, most notably from a UN report that said Tether \u201ca preferred choice\u201d for fraudsters and money launderers in East and Southeast Asia. Tether responded to the UN report in January, saying it was \u201cdisappointed in the UN\u2019s assessment that singles out USDT, highlighting its involvement in illicit activity while ignoring its role in helping developing economies in emerging markets.\u201d Other analysts have concluded a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $58,000 \u2014 levels not seen since the end of February \u2014 should the conflict between Iran and Israel escalate. To be sure, the industry could rally if the inflation falls faster than expected, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Rudick said. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETF flows could pick up, and investors may buy the bullish halving narrative, he added. However, Rudick said none of those catalysts \u201cseem too likely.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why $104bn Tether \u2018exists at the pleasure\u2019 of the banking system",
                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Analysts are keeping a close eye on whether the Fed changes its tune on rate cuts.\nWith halving on the way, Bitcoin is still up 105% over the last 12 months.\nChallenging market will test 10 spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds.",
                "body": " The halving was baked into Bitcoin\u2019s price long ago. That much we know. Now analysts are growing increasingly anxious that the recent rally \u2014 a most welcome narrative for investors after a long bear market \u2014 will have to overcome a number of challenges to keep going. And the sobering news is that these obstacles have nothing to do with crypto. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what propels us higher near term,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, there\u2019s loads of positivity still fizzing in the market. We now live in a world with 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. A year ago that looked virtually impossible. And Bitcoin is still up 105% in the last 12 months. But the \u201cmonster retail\u201d inflows for those ETFs have dropped in recent weeks. And the \u201chalving will soon be behind us,\u201d which means the key drivers of the recent rally may be \u201cwaning,\u201d Rudick said. The halving will slash the rewards Bitcoin miners get for maintaining the blockchain, reducing the creation of new coins by half, meaning there will be fewer new tokens hitting the market. At the same time, the threat of a regional war in the Middle East is rattling investors. And with US consumer prices not falling as quickly as economists would like, the Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts, which \u201crisk-on\u201d investors in stocks and crypto are counting on for a boost. Rudick also noted that repatriations from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to pay roughly 142,000 Bitcoin to more than 10,000 creditors. That may exacerbate prices as creditors seek the return of their funds either through fiat or cryptocurrencies. Tether is facing pressure from regulators, which could also be a risk, Rudick said. The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation has been under fire this year, most notably from a UN report that said Tether \u201ca preferred choice\u201d for fraudsters and money launderers in East and Southeast Asia. Tether responded to the UN report in January, saying it was \u201cdisappointed in the UN\u2019s assessment that singles out USDT, highlighting its involvement in illicit activity while ignoring its role in helping developing economies in emerging markets.\u201d Other analysts have concluded a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $58,000 \u2014 levels not seen since the end of February \u2014 should the conflict between Iran and Israel escalate. To be sure, the industry could rally if the inflation falls faster than expected, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Rudick said. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETF flows could pick up, and investors may buy the bullish halving narrative, he added. However, Rudick said none of those catalysts \u201cseem too likely.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

                "headline": "Circle\u2019s $2.4bn dominance on Solana shows stablecoin bet is paying off",
                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "The ECB said Bitcoin failed to deliver on a number of points.\nPantera countered in a point-by-point rebuttal.\nBitcoin layer protocols could enable digital payments, Pantera says.",

Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Stablecoin giant elbowed its way into Bitcoin mining with plants in Latin America.\n'We are first focusing on building renewable energy stations,' Ardoino told DL News.\nTether is taking advantage of concentration of the sector in the US.",
                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "headline": "ZkLink looks to solve Ethereum\u2019s fragmented liquidity with a layer 3 \u2014 but there are risks",
                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "body": " The halving was baked into Bitcoin\u2019s price long ago. That much we know. Now analysts are growing increasingly anxious that the recent rally \u2014 a most welcome narrative for investors after a long bear market \u2014 will have to overcome a number of challenges to keep going. And the sobering news is that these obstacles have nothing to do with crypto. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what propels us higher near term,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, there\u2019s loads of positivity still fizzing in the market. We now live in a world with 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. A year ago that looked virtually impossible. And Bitcoin is still up 105% in the last 12 months. But the \u201cmonster retail\u201d inflows for those ETFs have dropped in recent weeks. And the \u201chalving will soon be behind us,\u201d which means the key drivers of the recent rally may be \u201cwaning,\u201d Rudick said. The halving will slash the rewards Bitcoin miners get for maintaining the blockchain, reducing the creation of new coins by half, meaning there will be fewer new tokens hitting the market. At the same time, the threat of a regional war in the Middle East is rattling investors. And with US consumer prices not falling as quickly as economists would like, the Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts, which \u201crisk-on\u201d investors in stocks and crypto are counting on for a boost. Rudick also noted that repatriations from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to pay roughly 142,000 Bitcoin to more than 10,000 creditors. That may exacerbate prices as creditors seek the return of their funds either through fiat or cryptocurrencies. Tether is facing pressure from regulators, which could also be a risk, Rudick said. The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation has been under fire this year, most notably from a UN report that said Tether \u201ca preferred choice\u201d for fraudsters and money launderers in East and Southeast Asia. Tether responded to the UN report in January, saying it was \u201cdisappointed in the UN\u2019s assessment that singles out USDT, highlighting its involvement in illicit activity while ignoring its role in helping developing economies in emerging markets.\u201d Other analysts have concluded a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $58,000 \u2014 levels not seen since the end of February \u2014 should the conflict between Iran and Israel escalate. To be sure, the industry could rally if the inflation falls faster than expected, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Rudick said. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETF flows could pick up, and investors may buy the bullish halving narrative, he added. However, Rudick said none of those catalysts \u201cseem too likely.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Why $104bn Tether \u2018exists at the pleasure\u2019 of the banking system",
                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "headline": "Bitcoin\u2019s halving rally gives way to worries about geopolitical risks and the Fed\u2019s rate move",
                "keypoints": "Analysts are keeping a close eye on whether the Fed changes its tune on rate cuts.\nWith halving on the way, Bitcoin is still up 105% over the last 12 months.\nChallenging market will test 10 spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds.",
                "body": " The halving was baked into Bitcoin\u2019s price long ago. That much we know. Now analysts are growing increasingly anxious that the recent rally \u2014 a most welcome narrative for investors after a long bear market \u2014 will have to overcome a number of challenges to keep going. And the sobering news is that these obstacles have nothing to do with crypto. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what propels us higher near term,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, there\u2019s loads of positivity still fizzing in the market. We now live in a world with 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. A year ago that looked virtually impossible. And Bitcoin is still up 105% in the last 12 months. But the \u201cmonster retail\u201d inflows for those ETFs have dropped in recent weeks. And the \u201chalving will soon be behind us,\u201d which means the key drivers of the recent rally may be \u201cwaning,\u201d Rudick said. The halving will slash the rewards Bitcoin miners get for maintaining the blockchain, reducing the creation of new coins by half, meaning there will be fewer new tokens hitting the market. At the same time, the threat of a regional war in the Middle East is rattling investors. And with US consumer prices not falling as quickly as economists would like, the Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts, which \u201crisk-on\u201d investors in stocks and crypto are counting on for a boost. Rudick also noted that repatriations from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to pay roughly 142,000 Bitcoin to more than 10,000 creditors. That may exacerbate prices as creditors seek the return of their funds either through fiat or cryptocurrencies. Tether is facing pressure from regulators, which could also be a risk, Rudick said. The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation has been under fire this year, most notably from a UN report that said Tether \u201ca preferred choice\u201d for fraudsters and money launderers in East and Southeast Asia. Tether responded to the UN report in January, saying it was \u201cdisappointed in the UN\u2019s assessment that singles out USDT, highlighting its involvement in illicit activity while ignoring its role in helping developing economies in emerging markets.\u201d Other analysts have concluded a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $58,000 \u2014 levels not seen since the end of February \u2014 should the conflict between Iran and Israel escalate. To be sure, the industry could rally if the inflation falls faster than expected, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Rudick said. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETF flows could pick up, and investors may buy the bullish halving narrative, he added. However, Rudick said none of those catalysts \u201cseem too likely.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

                "headline": "Circle\u2019s $2.4bn dominance on Solana shows stablecoin bet is paying off",
                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Stablecoin giant elbowed its way into Bitcoin mining with plants in Latin America.\n'We are first focusing on building renewable energy stations,' Ardoino told DL News.\nTether is taking advantage of concentration of the sector in the US.",
                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Ethena Labs airdropped over $500 million in ENA tokens to active users in a six-week airdrop campaign.\nUSDe has reached over $1.9 billion in total supply, adding $361 million since Monday.\nFollowing the success of its initial airdrop, Ethena announced a second campaign that will run until September 2.",
                "body": " Airdrop chasers scooped up more than $500 million from Ethena\u2019s first airdrop. The over 90,000 users who participated in Ethena\u2019s six-week airdrop campaign \u2014 which kicked off on February 19 \u2014 were eligible for the airdrop, the first of several planned. The returns for some have been impressive, too. A user who locked in $10,000 worth of USDe on the first day of the campaign would have received approximately 9,000 ENA tokens, around $9,000 at current prices. Other leveraged strategies, such as using yield tokens on the DeFi protocol Pendle, offered even greater returns, offering users up to an 800% return. The campaign let users accumulate points, called \u201cshards,\u201d through a range of activities, including buying and holding the buzzy new stablecoin, using USDe in lending protocols, and providing liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Airdrop recipients, who account for 5% of the total 15 billion ENA supply, were required to claim their tokens on the Ethereum mainnet. As of 2 PM London time, roughly a third of users had claimed their airdrop. Of all the stablecoins on the market, Ethena\u2019s offering differs from that of market leaders like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. Instead of reportedly holding an excess of cash and crypto reserves, USDe maintains its peg to the dollar using a trading strategy that pairs liquid Ether staking tokens with short Ether perpetual futures. Ethena designed its airdrop campaign to incentivise participation, with multipliers ranging from 5 to 20 times the shards earned per day, depending on the activity. Shards were converted into ENA tokens, Ethena\u2019s governance token, which launched on Tuesday at an initial price of $0.59. ENA token holders can vote on key aspects of Ethena\u2019s operation, future integrations, the exchanges and custodians it relies on, community grants, and more. The value of ENA has since appreciated by 72%, reaching $1.02, implying a $1.4 billion market capitalisation. The airdrop campaign was set to last three months or until USDe reached a circulating supply of $1 billion. USDe surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 13, and its circulating supply currently stands at $1.9 billion. Now, airdrop chasers are piling back in for Ethena Labs\u2019 second airdrop later this year, with over $361 million added to its supply since Monday. For those who didn\u2019t qualify for the first airdrop, Ethena has already announced plans for its second airdrop campaign. Users appear interested, with over $361 million added to the USDe supply since the start of season two. In the second campaign, Ethena introduces a novel reward system where users can accumulate points, named \u201csats,\u201d a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin perpetual futures markets to continue growing USDe. The term \u201csats\u201d not only reflects the campaign\u2019s new direction but also pays homage to Bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit of account, satoshis, commonly referred to as sats. Ethena sats are rewarded for holding USDe, depositing USDe in liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, lending or borrowing USDe on money markets, and more. The second campaign is expected to last until September 2, or when the total USDe supply reaches $5 billion, whichever comes first. Alongside anticipation around the ENA airdrop, the growth has also been driven by the more than 35% yield it offers to USDe stakers. This source of yield and USDe\u2019s rapid growth have led to debate about its sustainability and risks. To generate this yield, Ethena relies on funding rates on perpetual trading markets to stay positive. When traders are more bullish, funding rates tend to stay positive, and when they are more bearish, they flip negative. Since Ethena only recently launched in a bull market, USDe has not been tested in an environment with consistently negative funding rates. Ethena relies on centralised exchanges to maintain the USDe peg through its trading strategy, piling on additional counterparty risk. Ryan Celaj is a data correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Tether has a fragile relationship with the US banking system.\nNeither the Federal Reserve nor the US Treasury are happy with the way the company is integrated in the broader financial system.",
                "body": " With more than $104 billion in market value, USDT is by far the largest stablecoin in the world. While the coin\u2019s issuer, Tether, has been plagued for years with rumours that its assets aren\u2019t fully backed, Arthur Hayes, founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, recently wrote that the firm\u2019s weaknesses have nothing to do with the state of its reserves. Rather, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s integrated into the broader financial system that poses risks to the company. According to Hayes, Tether\u2019s vulnerabilities lie in its relationships with the Federal Reserve, the US Treasury, and its own banking partners. \u201cTether exists at the pleasure of its poorer TradFi banking partners,\u201d Hayes wrote, using the crypto term for traditional finance. \u201cBanks\u2019 jealousy and the problems Tether creates for the guardians of Pax Americana\u2019s financial system could instantly spell the end for Tether,\u201d he added. The first pain point concerns Tether\u2019s five banking partners \u2014 Britannia Bank & Trust, Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, Ansbacher, and Deltec Bank and Trust. The issue, according to Hayes, is that none of these banks possess master accounts at the Federal Reserve. That means they must each use a correspondent bank to move Tether\u2019s US dollars across the financial system. And while Tether\u2019s banking partners are comfortable with serving crypto businesses like Tether, their correspondent banks may not feel the same way. \u201cSometimes certain crypto clients are offboarded from the smaller banks at the behest of the correspondent bank,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cIf the smaller bank doesn\u2019t comply, they lose their correspondent banking relationship along with the ability to move dollars internationally.\u201d In other words, these correspondent banks could pressure Tether\u2019s banking partners to drop the company \u2014 which, in turn, would exclude Tether from the financial system. Tether also acts as a fully reserved bank, Hayes said, because it takes US dollar deposits, issues USDT coins in return, and doesn\u2019t loan the deposits. But the US central bank doesn\u2019t like fully reserved banks, according to Hayes. That\u2019s because they\u2019re expensive: The Federal Reserve pays interest on the banking system\u2019s reserves to incentivise fractional banks \u2014 banks that do loan some of their deposits \u2014 to not lend too much, with the aim of avoiding another banking failure like in 2008. While Tether cannot deposit directly with the Federal Reserve, it has access to a similar program through money-market funds. The firm has over $80 billion in money-market funds and Treasury bills. The interest rate it receives on these is close to the federal funding rate, which now sits in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Put differently, the Federal Reserve is paying Tether billions of dollars for simply processing USDT deposits and redemptions. \u201cTether is arbing the Fed. And the Fed no likey,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIf [correspondent] banks drop Tether for some reason, the Fed will do nothing to help.\u201d The US Treasury isn\u2019t too keen on Tether either, Hayes said, because Tether\u2019s Treasury bill holdings are huge. Tether was among the top 22 largest holders of US debt in September \u2014 ahead of other nations like the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Mexico, and Australia, according to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. And with the US Treasury market\u2019s liquidity in decline, a smaller amount of selling would be needed to upset the market. \u201cIf Tether had to quickly sell down its holdings for whatever reason, it could cause chaos for global bond markets,\u201d Hayes said. The Treasury would likely step in to make sure Tether is able to unwind its positions in an orderly way should correspondent banks decide to cut it off, Hayes said. \u201cBut what Yellen certainly won\u2019t do is help Tether find another long-term banking partner,\u201d he added, referring to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Hayes\u2019 fund, Maelstrom, is a founding advisor to Ethena Labs \u2014 a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin in February. Tether didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

                "keypoints": "Volume on Solana\u2019s decentralised exchanges has plummeted over the past week.\nTrading on the blockchain is dominated by memecoins and a few core assets, like stablecoins and Solana\u2019s SOL.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s memecoin frenzy, which saw the blockchain briefly overtake Ethereum in terms of transaction volume, appears to be fizzling. The volume generated by decentralised exchanges on Solana has declined 61% over the past week, according to data from DefiLlama. The drop is particularly steep on Raydium, Solana\u2019s largest decentralised exchange. There, trading volume fell 72% over the past week. Aside from stablecoins and Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency, SOL, memecoins have been Solana\u2019s most popular tokens in March. \u201cMid- and large-cap tokens on Solana that are linked to actual projects \u2026 have maintained a constant percentage of the overall trading volume on Solana,\u201d Messari analyst Ally Zach told DL News. \u201cWhereas the volume corresponding to memes has grown substantially over the past few months to make up almost 30% of the total volume on Solana.\u201d Over the past week, five of the 10 most-traded tokens have been memecoins, according to data gathered by Zach. With the exception of MEW, a memecoin that launched on Monday, interest in those tokens has fallen faster than interest in SOL, USDT, USDC, and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. It ends a frenzy in retail trading that appeared to culminate last week in the proliferation of offensive tokens bearing racist and antisemitic tickers \u2014 a controversial collision of the permissionless nature of decentralised finance and crypto\u2019s propensity to attract self-described \u201cedgelords.\u201d Prominent developers including Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko rushed to denounce the tokens, which feature all-caps tickers bearing anti-Black slurs and antisemitic tropes. Decentralised exchanges are, by definition, permissionless, meaning anyone can create a trading pair with any two tokens without asking permission from the developers who made the protocol. But those developers typically have control over the exchange\u2019s user interface, the website through which most people access the exchange. The offensive tokens kicked off a debate over developers\u2019 responsibility to police their projects\u2019 user interfaces. Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralised exchange, said the developers behind decentralised exchanges should monitor their user interfaces. \u201cBut if you run a front end with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash.\u201d DEX Screener, a website that allows users to follow trading pools on decentralised exchanges, said it will review its content moderation policy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be the gatekeepers of what happens on-chain, but we\u2019re definitely not here to spread hate,\u201d the company wrote on X. The offensive tokens could still be found on DEX Screener Wednesday. DEX Screener didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. DEX Screener\u2019s announcement was controversial. Autism Capital, a popular X account that shot to fame during the collapse of FTX, lambasted the decision, writing, \u201cDo not recreate what crypto was originally created to fight against.\u201d Representatives of Solana\u2019s three largest decentralised exchanges, Raydium, Orca and Meteora, didn\u2019t immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment. The controversy isn\u2019t unique to Solana. In 2017, some Ethereum users complained that a proliferation of racist tokens was hurting the blockchain. Zach, the Messari analyst, attributed last week\u2019s surge to a relatively new phenomenon: raising money for a token before its launch. In a so-called presale, investors transfer funds to a specified wallet address to receive a future token allocation proportionate to their investment. Solana saw 33 presales between March 12 to 23 that collectively raised over 796,000 SOL, about $150 million, according to data gathered by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. \u201cAt this point, that meta has mostly died down,\u201d Messari analyst Zach told DL News. \u201cThat being said, even though volumes are down about 53% from last week, Solana is still seeing above normal trading volumes.\u201d Despite their popularity, many presales have left investors empty-handed. SLERF, for example, ended up inadvertently destroying over $10 million of investor funds. A few managed to launch successfully. After its presale, BOME quickly reached a market capitalization exceeding $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, the memecoin mania has overtaken another blockchain: the Coinbase-built Base. Trading volumes on Base have spiked by 63% in the last week, driven largely by memecoins. But Base isn\u2019t necessarily sucking up Solana\u2019s memecoin energy \u2014 the Ethereum rollup processed just one-fifth of Solana\u2019s overall transaction volume over the past week. \u201cAs the attention [on Solana] wanes from memecoins, the volume is bound to go down on Solana,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that attention in the markets (and the corresponding volumes) moves cyclically so I\u2019d expect the volumes on Solana to surge again when attention pivots back to memes.\u201d"

                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "How EU\u2019s \u2018complete mess\u2019 on stablecoin regulation risks delistings with MiCA deadline approaching",
                "keypoints": "A dual definition of e-money tokens in MiCA has experts ringing alarm bells.\nStablecoin laws come into effect on June 30.\nA new regulation may fix the problem.",
                "body": " There\u2019s only two months to go before Europe\u2019s hotly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets rules, or MiCA, go into effect. And Europe\u2019s crypto industry and legal experts are ringing alarm bells. Experts worry that the regulations are so onerous and confusing that they will drive out some stablecoins starting on June 30 when the laws kick in. It will be a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said Victor Charpiat, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a global law firm. The problem lies in a double definition of so-called e-money tokens, or EMTs. Those are stablecoins that are pegged to a currency, like the euro or the dollar. Two popular stablecoins in this category dominate crypto markets. Tether\u2019s USDT has a market value of $110 billion, and Circle\u2019s USDC has $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. That confusion stems from \u201ccrypto platforms not understanding how they should handle EMTs, and opposing interpretations coming from different national regulators,\u201d Charpiat told DL News. The worst case scenario would be to resolve the issue at the European Court of Justice, he said. The term e-money tokens is defined twice in the MiCA text, which became law almost a year ago. The first defines EMTs as a type of crypto asset. The second definition implies that e-money tokens are equivalent to electronic money \u2014 a term used since 2000 as digital cash. Delistings may happen if the rules aren\u2019t cleared up. \u201cLike many other cryptocurrency exchanges, we have mitigating plans in place to delist coins if issuers are not regulated by June 30,\u201d a spokesperson for crypto exchange Bitstamp told DL News. An industry letter sent to EU regulators and lawmakers seen by DL News warned that the current text could \u201clead to a significant drop in economic activity around EMTs in the EU.\u201d Financial institutions handling e-money fall under more burdensome regulations for payment services \u2014 more so than crypto asset service providers. The dual definition in MiCA could create \u201ca chilling effect on the development of e-money tokens in Europe,\u201d said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIf EU rules are so onerous that a viable, commercial business case cannot be made, firms will naturally seek out other jurisdictions, which undermines the value of the EU regime,\u201d he told DL News. Europe\u2019s crypto advocates are rallying to obtain short-term clarity from regulators, and a longer-term fix within the EU\u2019s bill revising rules for payment services, which lawmakers in the European Parliament moved ahead in a vote on Tuesday. The Payment Services Regulation, or PSR, bill passed a plenary vote to move on to the next phase of negotiations. In the text, lawmakers wrote: \u201cTo avoid duplicative requirements, it is important [to] clearly set out the instances where electronic money tokens should instead be subject to this Regulation.\u201d Another amendment to the bill said that \u201cpayment transactions used for the execution of trading and settlement services using electronic money tokens\u201d \u2014 the ones defined as crypto assets \u2014 are excluded from the PSR. That would potentially be a relief for the industry. Negotiations will continue with finance ministers after the European elections in June. And the text signals that the EMT issue will be addressed. \u201cIndustry is encouraged that parliament has understood the importance of clarity for EMTs,\u201d Foster said. But this regulation, if it passes the rest of negotiations between Parliament and finance ministers in the Council of the EU, won\u2019t go live until at least 2027. That leaves around a three-year gap between the PSR and MiCA. \u201cWe hope to have clarity before MiCA applies,\u201d Foster said. Otherwise, once the laws come into effect, crypto platforms may not know whether they need to comply with payment services laws or crypto asset laws to custody and transfer EMTs. Investors would have different tax implications on their EMT holdings, and it would determine how they can use their EMT funds. As crypto firms and investors engage with lawyers and regulators, they will reach opposing conclusions, Charpiat said. That could lead to litigation. National regulators may give different interpretations to the financial firms handling EMTs that they are supervising. The European Banking Authority, responsible for implementing and supervising stablecoin laws, told DL News it is \u201ctaking steps to promote convergence in the application of MiCA\u201d together with the European Commission. The European Commission, which first drafted MiCA, said that \u201cEMT issuers can only be e-money institutions and credit institutions.\u201d They would need to be \u201clicensed either under the E-Money Directive, or have a banking licence,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThere is a dual regime that applies because an e-money token is at the same time a crypto asset and also e-money,\u201d Patrick Hansen, Circle\u2019s senior director for EU strategy and policy, said at a Frankfurt conference in February. For global stablecoin players like Circle, which issue e-money tokens in other jurisdictions, including the US, issuing such a stablecoin in the EU means navigating \u201ccomplex and challenging double issuer constructs,\u201d he said. It isn\u2019t clear for which activities \u2014 from trading to payments \u2014 which definition would apply. Circle has applied for an e-money institution licence in France. Tether, which has been in regulatory crosshairs, is also busy unpacking MiCA\u2019s \u201ccomplexities,\u201d on e-money definitions and EU requirements, a spokesperson said. Tether is \u201cworking to consider the impact of these provisions.\u201d Jon Egilsson, chair and co-founder of euro-backed stablecoin issuer Monerium, is more optimistic. \u201cWe are MiCA compliant today, that\u2019s not an issue,\u201d Egilsson said. That\u2019s because Monerium is a licensed e-money institution from 2019. But that has come with a high regulatory cost that other firms will need to start facing once MiCA comes into force. \u201cWe have to be audited, we have to submit reports on a regular basis \u2014 it is a lot of cost in order to operate,\u201d he told DL News. Up until now, \u201cother players that we compete with, they are allowed to operate without any licence.\u201d Egilsson and others argue that the rules for payment services were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. Those laws are designed to protect the customer if an institution transfers funds on behalf of a customer, using a third party for settlement. \u201cIn web 3, the transaction is the settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that the blockchain network is the payment rail.\u201d Inbar Preiss is a Brussels-based regulation correspondent.

                "headline": "How Binance head Richard Teng is struggling to impose order as CZ\u2019s sentencing looms",
                "keypoints": "Binance is blocked in the Philippines and charged with money laundering in Nigeria.\nFormer CEO Zhao will be sentenced on April 30 for violating US banking law.\nBinance's market share in crypto trading dipped in the last month.",
                "body": " When Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao resigned in disgrace in November, his successor Richard Teng pledged a new era was dawning for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Disregarding regulation was out. And compliance was in. With Zhao, 47, set to be sentenced on April 30 for violating US banking law, delivering on that promise is proving to be problematic. Throughout its seven-year history, regulators around the world have steadily faulted Binance for operating in their markets without the necessary licences. While Zhao painted Binance as a new breed of company that didn\u2019t play by old rules, his approach bucked deeply rooted practices for protecting investors from fraud, and the financial system from dirty money. Even as Teng changes course \u2014 and he\u2019s had some success \u2014 some regulators are finally catching up with Binance. And the toll is running high. In March, officials in the Philippines blocked Binance after the exchange failed to get licenced following months of warnings. Now authorities are going so far as to work with Apple and Google to remove Binance from their app stores. Meanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agency has charged Binance with money laundering and tax evasion. The efforts are part of a wide-ranging investigation into allegations the company is facilitating illicit financial transactions on its platform. Nigerian authorities have also charged two Binance executives with the same allegations, and one, Tigran Gambaryan, has been detained for almost nine weeks pending bail and a trial. The case follows the same contours as the action brought by multiple US agencies last year. On November 21, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law by failing to prevent criminals and sanctioned entities from using its platform to conduct illicit transactions. The company paid $4.3 billion in penalties, and Zhao, who also pleaded guilty, resigned as CEO. This week, US prosecutors asked a federal court in Seattle to sentence Zhao to a three-year term. Zhao\u2019s lawyers countered by pleading for probation for their client. Next Tuesday, the onetime crypto chieftain will learn his fate. Binance CEO Richard Teng (left), speaking in Paris this month, faces numerous regulatory challenges. Binance has denied the allegations in Nigeria and Gambaryan pleaded not guilty to the charges. The company has not responded to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment on the situation in the Philippines. Media representatives also did not respond to a request for comment on this article. Meanwhile, Binance\u2019s market share of the spot crypto trading market dropped three percentage points, to 35%, in the last month, marking its lowest point since January, according to CCData. Yet it remains the leading centralised crypto exchange globally, with a dominating 42% share across spot and derivatives market, the data provider said. With a stint as a former regulator at Singapore\u2019s central bank, Teng would seem ideally suited to steer Binance onto safer ground. To that end, he said on April 9 that Binance will establish a global headquarters, and where it will be is anyone\u2019s guess. The move will reverse Zhao\u2019s determination to have Binance based nowhere. Teng also peppers his speeches with phrases such as \u201ccompliance focused\u201d and acknowledges that adhering to regulatory realities under the previous regime was \u201cinadequate.\u201d And Binance has made progress. It obtained an operational licence in Dubai from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority last week. Reports indicate Binance is planning to re-enter the Indian market \u2014 though it may have to pay a $2 million fine to do so. And in Thailand, it has re-entered the market through a venture with a local partner following a criminal complaint filed by the country\u2019s SEC in 2021 for operating in the country without the correct licenses. Yet Binance\u2019s regulatory crises in Asia and Africa overshadow these steps. In Nigeria, the central bank and state security officials blamed the exchange \u2014 and peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms more broadly \u2014 for tanking the nation\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, early this year. Authorities said Binance ran an illegal foreign exchange market that allowed users to trade naira for Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT. Investigators concluded that racketeers used Binance to manipulate the naira\u2019s exchange value, according to people familiar with the probe. In February, Binance dispatched two executives to Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, to address the issue. When talks quickly broke down, Nigerian authorities detained Gambaryan, Binance\u2019s US-based head of financial crime compliance, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, its Kenya-based regional head. The situation escalated in the weeks to come when Anjarwalla eluded his guards and escaped Nigeria with a second passport he had not surrendered. \u2018This is purely state-sanctioned hostage-taking.\u2019 Then Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the country\u2019s anti-corruption police, charged Binance and Gambaryan and incarcerated the executive in a prison. The former agent for the US Internal Revenue Service won\u2019t learn whether he\u2019ll be released on bail until May 17. \u201cThis is purely state-sanctioned hostage-taking,\u201d Mark Mordi, Gambaryan\u2019s lawyer, said in court proceedings on Tuesday monitored by DL News. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines said just days into the start of Teng\u2019s tenure last November that Binance was not licensed in the country. It vowed to ban access to the site and warned promoters that they could face a hefty fine and up to 21 years in prison for encouraging citizens to use the platform. That ban came into effect at the end of March when the government blocked access to the website. SEC Chair Emilio B. Aquino called continued access to Binance\u2019s platforms \u201ca threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos.\u201d But according to users in the Philippines, Binance is continuing to support Filipino users as long as they can access the site with a VPN. Indeed, for all of Teng\u2019s efforts it remains unclear precisely where Binance does operate. According to its website, the exchange\u2019s services are available in more than 100 countries but it only lists 45. The Philippines is still listed among them despite the ban.

                "keypoints": "Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told DL News his company is determined to cooperate with law enforcement.\nState oil giant PDVSA is trying to use Tether to sidestep IS sanctions.\n'We're not the police.'",
                "body": " When the US hit Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil producer with a new round of sanctions this week, the company did what many targeted entities do \u2014 it turned to Tether\u2019s stablecoin, USDT. As a super liquid substitute for the dollar with a market value of $110 billion, USDT offers entities booted from the international financial community with an alternative. But if Tether\u2019s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has his way, this lifeline won\u2019t last long. On Tuesday, Tether said it would freeze wallets linked to any entity that is trying to evade sanctions. Ardoino told DL News earlier this month that Tether is committed to working closely with law enforcement worldwide and cracking down on illicit financial transactions that use USDT. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep at night. We monitor everything we can, but we are not a country,\u201d said Ardoino. In working with different agencies and law enforcement, Tether said it has frozen about $500 million in USDT tokens. And it\u2019s careful not to interfere with ongoing investigations by freezing assets too soon, he said. \u201cThe more stuff moves, the more breadcrumbs you create,\u201d making it easier to follow the money. Ardoino hopes Tether\u2019s new stance will ease pressure from lawmakers and regulators on a stablecoin provider that has attracted a lot of controversy. In May, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and leading crypto critic on Capitol Hill, pointed to Tether and Bitcoin\u2019s role in the lethal fentanyl trade. A United Nations report published earlier this year found that $17 billion of USDT was tied to underground crypto exchanges, illegal trades, and criminal activities in Southeast Asia. TRM Labs, a crypto sleuthing company, called USDT the \u201ccurrency of choice\u201d for terrorism financing. A Chainalysis report showed that stablecoins, including Tether, make up roughly 60% of illicit transactions. Sanctioned entities \u201chave a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional means but still want to benefit from the stability it provides,\u201d the report states.

(Chainalysis/Chainalysis) JPMorgan Chase analysts told clients that USDT\u2019s dominance is \u201cnegative for the stablecoin universe and the crypto ecosystem more broadly.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that the company continues to rely on quarterly \u201cattestations\u201d rather than formal audits of its reserves. This is why Ardoino is keen on persuading one of the Big Four accounting firms to audit its books to demonstrate it has ample dollar reserves to back up USDT\u2019s peg. PDVSA workers march beneath banners depicting Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (left), the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (centre), and Maduro. Photocredit: Shutterstock Now, the Venezuela situation threatens to cast more doubt on Tether just as Ardoino is trying to turn the page. And this time, the stablecoin has been swept up in a US foreign policy confrontation. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that PDVSA\u2019s shift to Tether began last year, and the Biden Administration\u2019s new round of sanctions accelerated its use of the stablecoin. The oil sector is a crucial economic motor for the South American country, which boasts the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. The US has imposed economic sanctions to punish President Nicolas Maduro, a strongman who took over after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, for failing to hold free and fair elections. In response, Venezuela\u2019s oil giant urged new customers to set up a digital wallet and hold cryptocurrencies to circumvent those new sanctions, Reuters reported. Tether wasted no time in stating that it respects the sanctions list maintained by the US Treasury Department. \u201c[Tether] is committed to working to ensure sanction addresses are frozen promptly,\u201d a spokesperson told DL News. Ardoino said Tether had never worked directly with a sanctioned entity. Instead, he said these entities use USDT outside its own platform where market forces, and not the company\u2019s policies, prevail. \u201cSecondary markets are the blockchains and the other exchanges,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cBut there is no legislation that says that Tether is responsible for those tokens.\u201d The company has, however, frozen tokens on secondary markets in the past. In October, Tether froze roughly $873,000 in tokens that were linked to donations to Hamas and illicit activity in Ukraine. Similarly, in November, Tether froze $225 million in stolen USDT linked to crypto romance scams. Yet given the $17 billion in suspicious USDT identified by the UN, these relatively small sums show Tether has a long way to go. Tether says there\u2019s only so much it can do. \u201cWe are not the police,\u201d says Ardoino. \u201cWe are not law enforcement.\u201d Liam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent.

                "body": " Even as Asian markets such as Hong Kong lean into permitting Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, regulators in Thailand are taking a hard line on unauthorised digital asset service providers. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission is intensifying its crackdown on rogue platforms by blocking access them, according to comments made by SEC Secretary-general Pornanong Busaratrakul. The action is aimed at curbing money laundering activities. The SEC\u2019s statement cited previous disputes with Binance and Bybit as cases where they had taken legal action against unlicenced platforms. In 2021, Binance faced accusations from the SEC for operating without a licence. But in January, the world\u2019s top crypto exchange started operating a regulated crypto exchange in Thailand through a joint venture with Gulf Energy Development, which is led by Thai billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi. Meanwhile, the SEC flagged Bybit in December 2023 for operating without official permission. Despite the regulatory heat, Bybit continues to engage Thai consumers. In February, it ran competitions with prizes, including 15,000 USDT for top traders and luxury items such as iPhones and iPads for significant trades, for Thai users. The SEC has urged users of unlicenced platforms to withdraw their assets promptly, drawing parallels to measures recently implemented in India and the Philippines. It remains unclear which specific platforms will face the SEC\u2019s impending restrictions. The action in Thailand underscores the balancing act finance regulators are taking across the continent. In Hong Kong, for instance, the Securities and Futures Commission has signalled it would approve crypto ETFs at the same time it is labouring to curb investment fraud by requiring digital asset providers to get licenced.

Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the country\u2019s anti-corruption police, said it has discovered alleged foreign exchange racketeering that is \u201cworse than Binance.\u201d \u201cThey call them P2P and all of that [and] we noticed in the last two days that dollars have started appreciating,\u201d EFCC chairman Ola Olukoyede said in a meeting on Tuesday monitored by DL News. \u201cIt was due to the activities of some of these guys on P2P platforms like \u2018coolcoin,\u2019\u201d Olukoyede said. It is likely Olukoyede is referring to the centralised crypto exchange platform KuCoin. \u2018That is crazy and when the government swings the ban hammer, we\u2019ll only have ourselves to blame.\u2019 The EFCC\u2019s top cop said the commission obtained a court order on Monday to freeze 300 of such accounts. One trader allegedly facilitated $15 billion in P2P transactions last year, the EFCC said. For Nigerian crypto investors, the situation feels eerily familiar as pro-government figures have already launched online campaigns against exchanges like KuCoin, ByBit, and OKX. Nigeria\u2019s central bank, on Wednesday, debunked a fake directive purporting to direct commercial lenders to freeze accounts of crypto traders. The bogus document also called on law enforcement agencies to arrest persons involved in crypto peer-to-peer trading. Platforms like KuCoin, ByBit, and OKX have become the alternative for Nigerians to trade the naira for Tether\u2019s USDT. Some bad actors are already publishing bogus quotes on those platforms, said one crypto trader who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity. \u201cSome of my colleagues are quoting 2,000 NGN per dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is crazy and when the government swings the ban hammer, we\u2019ll only have ourselves to blame.\u201d Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, said a crypto ban is highly unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t see a crypto ban on the horizon because this government campaigned on the promise of using crypto and blockchain technology to improve our financial sector,\u201d Ophi told DL News on Wednesday. Ophi advised Nigeria\u2019s government to follow in South Africa\u2019s footsteps by creating a favourable regulatory landscape for crypto exchanges. South African regulators licensed 60 crypto platforms earlier this month in a landmark for crypto regulations in Africa. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Filipino regulators are strengthening their prohibition of unlicenced exchange.\nCEO Richard Teng is struggling to get Binance compliant worldwide.\nThe Asian nation has warned investors for months to be wary of Binance.",
                "body": " In a mounting crisis for Binance CEO Richard Teng, regulators in the Philippines are working with tech giants Google and Apple to remove the crypto exchange\u2019s applications from their local app stores, the agency confirmed in a statement on April 23. The move marks an escalation after the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked the website of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange at the end of March. \u201cThe SEC has identified [Binance] and concluded that the public\u2019s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos,\u201d SEC Chair Emilio B. Aquino said in the letters sent on April 19. Aquino said the removal and blockade of Binance apps are essential steps to \u201cprevent the proliferation of illegal activities by the platform in the Philippines and to shield the investing public from its adverse effects on our economy.\u201d Binance media representatives did not respond to a request for comment by DL News. The action comes as Teng struggles to revamp the freewheeling business model left by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ. Zhao eschewed obtaining licences or registering with the regulators in markets where Binance operated. Now that lack of compliance is backfiring in not only the Philippines but also in Nigeria, where the company has been charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Two Binance executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, have also been charged in Nigeria, and the former, who pleaded not guilty, is incarcerated in a prison pending trial. The crackdown in Manila follows a November warning, when the SEC announced plans to block access to Binance due to it operating without a licence in the country. The agency said that salesmen, brokers, and influencers promoting its services could face up to 21 years in prison and fines of $90,000. The SEC also said it provided ample warning and opportunity for investors to withdraw from Binance and reallocate their funds to authorised investment platforms. But a lack of clarity as to exactly when it would happen led to a rush of users trying to withdraw funds from the platform when the website block was implemented. As a result, vendors on the Binance peer-to-peer marketplace offered Tether\u2019s USDT at a discount of 5 to 7% as they attempted to liquidate their holdings. The SEC has not yet announced any actions against other international exchanges which continue to operate in the Philippines without the correct licences. Got a story about crypto in Asia?

                "headline": "Tether\u2019s CEO just told us why the Big Four won\u2019t audit reserves backing $108bn stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Paolo Ardoino told DL News Tether wants to be audited by one of the top global accounting firms.\nHe explained why the issuer still relies on 'attestations' for its reserves.\nTether's utility makes it a vital cog in the crypto marketplace.",
                "body": " Ever since Tether came to dominate the stablecoin market, the issuer has been bedevilled by a big question \u2014 why doesn\u2019t the company produce audits of its reserves? Now CEO Paolo Ardoino has provided an answer. In an interview with DL News, he said the Big Four accounting firms \u2014 Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG \u2014 are afraid to work with Tether because they fear it will damage their reputations. \u201cNone of the Big Four companies will audit us,\u201d Ardoino said. But he said securing one of them as Tether\u2019s auditor is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d An audit by one of those global firms would calm the perennial jitters investors have about the issuer of USDT, the world\u2019s top stablecoin with a $108 billion market value. Tether has become an indispensable cog in the machinery of the crypto market. It enables users to move between fiat currencies and digital assets. Across every major cryptocurrency exchange, USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency against Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means that when speculators buy or sell more of their digital assets for dollars, they\u2019re usually doing it in Tether\u2019s USDT. This is why it\u2019s so important for Tether to show that it has the cash to back up USDT every quarter. But between the FTX disaster and the hacks, heists, and regulatory crackdowns in crypto, it hasn\u2019t been easy to sign on as a client for one of those top accounting outfits. \u201cSo you are a Big Four auditing firm, and you have the entire banking industry that is your customer,\u201d Ardoino said. \u201cWhy would you risk 100,000 customers for a couple of stablecoins?\u201d It didn\u2019t help when Circle, Tether\u2019s archrival, got swept up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Circle held $3.3 billion in deposits at the lender. As Circle\u2019s own customers bailed out of its stablecoin, USDC briefly slipped its dollar peg. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts and staunch crypto critic, decried \u201csham audits\u201d of crypto firms. \u201cYou can see how certain parts of the US Congress is against crypto,\u201d Ardoino said. Media representatives for the Big Four accounting firms did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comments. Ardoino added that stablecoin providers like Tether and Circle probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucrative a client as traditional financial firms because blockchain-recorded assets makes them easier to audit. Still, Ardoino insists he wants an upgrade from the quarterly attestations prepared by a firm called BDO Italia. \u201cWe are trying to make the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build relationships to get the audit from a Big Four firm\u201d From 2014 to 2017, Tether did not publish reports on reserves. Since 2022, Tether has relied on quarterly attestations. The difference between an attestation and an audit is subtle but important. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices. An accounting firm may discover risks unknown to the business in question, and an audit may also reveal compliance issues at the business. An attestation means the business in question \u2014 in this case, Tether \u2014 provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm\u2019s financial review. Regarding BDO Italia\u2019s latest attestation, for example, the firm writes that its analysis is limited to the fourth quarter. This minor accounting distinction has become major as the stablecoin has grown in importance and value over the past decade. For a market as volatile as crypto, stablecoins are a life raft for investors looking for stability. That\u2019s because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro. There are several flavours of stablecoins on the market, but Tether uses a reserves model. It claims that for every USDT in circulation, the firm holds an equivalent real-world dollar. According to the latest attestation in December, Tether held $80 billion in US Treasury bonds in its reserves, along with cash, Bitcoin, and gold. Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Analysts are keeping a close eye on whether the Fed changes its tune on rate cuts.\nWith halving on the way, Bitcoin is still up 105% over the last 12 months.\nChallenging market will test 10 spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds.",
                "body": " The halving was baked into Bitcoin\u2019s price long ago. That much we know. Now analysts are growing increasingly anxious that the recent rally \u2014 a most welcome narrative for investors after a long bear market \u2014 will have to overcome a number of challenges to keep going. And the sobering news is that these obstacles have nothing to do with crypto. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what propels us higher near term,\u201d Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News. To be sure, there\u2019s loads of positivity still fizzing in the market. We now live in a world with 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. A year ago that looked virtually impossible. And Bitcoin is still up 105% in the last 12 months. But the \u201cmonster retail\u201d inflows for those ETFs have dropped in recent weeks. And the \u201chalving will soon be behind us,\u201d which means the key drivers of the recent rally may be \u201cwaning,\u201d Rudick said. The halving will slash the rewards Bitcoin miners get for maintaining the blockchain, reducing the creation of new coins by half, meaning there will be fewer new tokens hitting the market. At the same time, the threat of a regional war in the Middle East is rattling investors. And with US consumer prices not falling as quickly as economists would like, the Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts, which \u201crisk-on\u201d investors in stocks and crypto are counting on for a boost. Rudick also noted that repatriations from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox are set to pay roughly 142,000 Bitcoin to more than 10,000 creditors. That may exacerbate prices as creditors seek the return of their funds either through fiat or cryptocurrencies. Tether is facing pressure from regulators, which could also be a risk, Rudick said. The largest stablecoin by market capitalisation has been under fire this year, most notably from a UN report that said Tether \u201ca preferred choice\u201d for fraudsters and money launderers in East and Southeast Asia. Tether responded to the UN report in January, saying it was \u201cdisappointed in the UN\u2019s assessment that singles out USDT, highlighting its involvement in illicit activity while ignoring its role in helping developing economies in emerging markets.\u201d Other analysts have concluded a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $58,000 \u2014 levels not seen since the end of February \u2014 should the conflict between Iran and Israel escalate. To be sure, the industry could rally if the inflation falls faster than expected, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Rudick said. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETF flows could pick up, and investors may buy the bullish halving narrative, he added. However, Rudick said none of those catalysts \u201cseem too likely.\u201d Sebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Solana's stablecoin market has regained its pre-FTX collapse level.\nOnly Coinbase\u2019s Base has grown its stablecoin market faster than Solana this year.\nOne stablecoin in particular is behind Solana's recent rise.",
                "body": "  Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply just blew past $3 billion, according to DefiLlama The supply has increased by a whopping 71% since the start of the year, according to blockchain analytics platform Artemis. That\u2019s the second-largest rise among major blockchains behind only Coinbase\u2019s Base. What\u2019s driving the latest rebound back on the speedy layer-1? Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap. (DeFi Llama/DeFi Llama) Austin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, chalked the growth up to Solana\u2019s efficiencies and low liquidity requirements. \u201cSolana is anywhere between five to seven times more capital efficient in its DeFi than other networks,\u201d Federa claimed during an industry event in Paris last week. \u201cWhat that means is that just a little bit of stablecoin liquidity can actually support a huge volume of transactions.\u201d The recent rise of memecoin trading on Solana has also been a boon. In March, the network even leapfrogged Ethereum trading volumes thanks to enticing six-figure returns on tokens named after presidents, canines, and pop stars. Besides any purported technical advantages or buzzy dog coin, there also appears to be a clear preference for one stablecoin in particular. Examining the composition of Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply shows Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin is far and away the stablecoin of choice on Solana. DeFiLlama data indicates that there are $2.43 billion in USDC on the network, with Tether trailing far behind at just under $800 million. \u2018Circle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain.\u2019 USDC accounts for over three-quarters of Solana\u2019s stablecoin market. This is surprising because on other blockchains like Ethereum, Tron, and Arbitrum, Tether\u2019s USDT \u2015 crypto\u2019s leading stable currency \u2015 is the dominant stablecoin. Tether\u2019s offering is also the market\u2019s largest, commanding more than $107 billion in value. USDC has a total value of $32 billion, per CoinGecko. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana hasn\u2019t been a lucky win for Circle, either. \u201cCircle and the Solana Foundation have actively promoted the use of USDC on the Solana blockchain,\u201d Eli\u00e9zer Ndinga, digital strategy chief at crypto investment firm 21shares, told DL News. \u201cThese efforts likely include incentives for developers to build using USDC and for traders and liquidity providers to adopt it within their platforms.\u201d Solend, a lending platform on Solana, offered up developer grants as high as 30,000 USDC back in 2022. SuperTeam, a Solana-centric promotional organization with outposts around the world, offers a similar grants program denominated in USDC, luring developers to build atop Solana. Indeed, the majority of bounties available by Superteam for supporting Solana projects are denominated in USDC. USDC\u2019s dominance on Solana also comes amid Circle\u2019s launch of its Cross Chain Transfer Protocol on the blockchain last month. Solana Foundation\u2019s Federa called the launch \u201chuge,\u201d adding that it\u2019s something developers \u201chave wanted for awhile.\u201d Users who wish to move USDC from Ethereum or other blockchains to Solana have to use protocols known as bridges in crypto. CCTP is a bridge protocol that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchains. The USDC being moved is burned on the sender blockchain, and an equal amount is natively minted on the receiver blockchain. It\u2019s one of the many efforts to unify DeFi\u2019s fragmented market, where liquidity is siloed in different protocols and blockchains. Apart from CCTP, USDC liquidity on Solana may also be boosted by Circle\u2019s launch of Web3 Services, a suite of software tools meant to facilitate the building and interaction with smart contracts. Dante Disparte, Circle\u2019s CSO and head of policy, was adamant that Circle isn\u2019t \u201cpicking winners or losers.\u201d \u201cWhere there is developer demand, these tools and capabilities will follow,\u201d he told DL News. Despite the latest increase, Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply is still well below its $6.1 billion peak of May 2022. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for crypto fraud, was a major Solana backer. That association contributed to Solana\u2019s decline following the exchange\u2019s failure. Part of that decline saw Solana\u2019s stablecoin supply fall by half immediately after the FTX collapse, a drop that lasted until the recovery process began over a year later.

                "keypoints": "Users withdrew almost $300 million in crypto from Solana lending protocol MarginFi on Wednesday.\nThe outflows began after the chaotic resignation of founder Edgar Pavlovsky.\nUsers have grown increasingly frustrated with the developers\u2019 refusal to issue an airdrop despite a long-running points programme.",
                "body": " Mounting anger at Solana lending protocol MarginFi boiled over Wednesday, when co-founder Edgar Pavlovsky abruptly resigned after saying he would sabotage a planned airdrop. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick [any kind of token],\u201d Pavlovsky said in a now-deleted tweet. Since then, investors have withdrawn crypto worth almost $300 million from MarginFi \u2014 about one-third of the protocol\u2019s deposits. Investors seem to have moved some of that crypto to competing Solana protocols Kamino and Solend, which saw their deposits jump 6% and 10%, respectively. MarginFi has been one of several protocols leading Solana\u2019s post-FTX DeFi renaissance. Launched in March 2023, the decentralised crypto lender and liquid staking provider saw the value of its crypto deposits peak on April 1, at $881 million. Its future plans include the launch of a decentralised stablecoin to rival Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT. But its growth belied investors\u2019 growing frustration with Mrgn, the company behind MarginFi. In July 2023, it became one of the first DeFi protocols to announce a points programme. \u201cWe wanted a real way to quantify user quality/activity. This was a step in that direction,\u201d co-founder MacBrennan Peet told DL News in December. Points programmes are widely considered a method of hinting at a future airdrop without explicitly committing to one \u2014 a way to lure users without drawing the attention of token-weary US regulators. As Solana competitors announced points programmes and released tokens of their own, MarginFi\u2019s social media posts began to fill with replies from people claiming to be users, angry they were getting \u201cstrung along.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very aware of the feedback,\u201d Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen told DL News in March. \u201cWe\u2019ve been crypto users for a long time so we understand the value and excitement around having a token, and ultimately we do want to please our customers.\u201d The controversy reached a tipping point Wednesday, when a partner company called SolBlaze accused Mrgn of violating an agreement by withholding crypto rewards meant for users. According to the agreement, investors who deposited SolBalze\u2019s liquid staking token, bSOL, in MarginFi would earn rewards in the form of SolBlaze\u2019s governance token, BLZE. SolBlaze accused Mrgn of refusing to distribute investors\u2019 BLZE rewards. SolBlaze also accused the company of selling millions of BLZE tokens it received in an airdrop \u2014 tokens meant to give Mrgn a say in SolBlaze governance. Peet called the accusation a \u201cslap in the face\u201d on X and attributed the delay in distributing rewards to congestion on Solana, rather than mismanagement or malice. SolBlaze later walked back some of its comments. Almost two hours later, however, Pavlovsky suggested in a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that he would try to sabotage an impending MarginFi airdrop. \u201cAfter today, feels right to maximally push off any kind of token,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill see what I can do internally to brick this.\u201d Two hours after that, he announced his resignation before unleashing a series of combative, and sometimes despairing, posts on social media. His resignation was later confirmed by the company, which cited \u201cinternal operational disagreements\u201d and Pavlovsky\u2019s \u201cown personal reasons.\u201d Pavlovsky elaborated on those disagreements on X Thursday. \u201cI also think the organisation could have moved a lot faster than it did getting to a token launch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think that\u2019s my fault and I wish a token could have launched in Jan/Feb this year.\u201d Peet and Pavlovsky did not immediately return requests for comment.

Pantera Capital was rebutting an ECB blog post from February in which the eurozone\u2019s central bankers said the advent of Bitcoin ETFs didn\u2019t change their take on the cryprocurrency\u2019s failure to fulfil its mission. Bitcoin, they said, was \u201cthe naked emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cOutside the darknet, the hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities, it is hardly used for payments at all,\u201d the ECB said. Pantera, which is led by Dan Morehead, the former head of macro trading at legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management, wasn\u2019t having it. Erik Lowe, Pantera\u2019s head of content, said the ECB\u2019s take repeated a \u201cmisconception\u201d that Bitcoin is, above all else, a good tool for money laundering. Once Bitcoin gained broader adoption, criminals realised that \u201can open public ledger is not the best method to move money around discreetly,\u201d he wrote. Blockchain analytics tools allow government agencies to identify bad actors, monitor their movement on public blockchains and take legal action. That\u2019s because in most cases, such ledgers show transparent and immutable transaction histories. \u2018We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the bitcoin market than any other of its size.\u2019 \u201cThe history of Bitcoin has been characterised by price manipulation and other types of fraud,\u201d according to the ECB, referring to crypto operators shut down for scams and fraudulent behaviour. But that notion is also outdated, according to Panteral Capital. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is more manipulation in the Bitcoin market than any other of its size,\u201d Lowe wrote. Still, smaller exchanges \u201cinflate their volumes to push themselves up the league tables to try to attack new customers,\u201d he added. But this is not relevant to the activity of established crypto. The ECB further argued that Bitcoin is a failed means of payment. Pantera agreed, although adding that layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, could still enable payment solutions for Bitcoin in the future. Still, the bank is missing the bigger point, the venture capital firm said. Lowe contended that Bitcoin\u2019s design \u201cwas supposed to be\u201d a hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. It\u2019s true that households and businesses in nations with stressed fiat currencies have increasingly sought to protect their wealth by converting their money into Bitcoin and stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. But Bitcoin proved to be no haven from inflation in 2022. Even though consumer prices in the US soared to 40-year-highs, investors dumped Bitcoin, along with stocks, triggering the worst bear market in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. Yet Bitcoin\u2019s built in scarcity has helped bolster its credibility in the eyes of policymakers and investors. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, a pre-programmed event where the amount that Bitcoin miners are able to extract is cut 50%. The next event is expected sometime around April 18 to 20.

This was the key message made by Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle Internet Financial, which issues USDC, in an exclusive interview with DL News on Tuesday. \u201cCirculation is an important proxy for success,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week. \u201cHowever, it cannot be the only proxy for success if you also care about the entire value chain around a stablecoin.\u201d Circle manages USDC, the second-largest US dollar-backed stablecoin with a value of $32 billion. That\u2019s about a third the size of market leader USDT, issued by Tether. And it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a surprise that Disparte would urge investors to consider other metrics, such as circulation, in sizing up stablecoins. Disparte said it\u2019s also important for users to weigh just how deeply a stablecoin is integrated into traditional payment networks. \u201cVisa has enabled USDC as a native settlement currency on the Visa network, which reaches 70 million merchants,\u201d he said. \u201cMastercard is not far behind. MoneyGram has created on- and off-ramps for USDC in all of its locations around the world.\u201d The stablecoin race \u2014 at least by market value \u2014- was much closer prior to the regional banking crisis last year. Circle held $3.3 billion of its reserves in Silicon Valley Bank, a tech industry stalwart that shocked investors when it suddenly collapsed following a run on deposits. As spooked investors withdrew deposits from Circle, USDC slipped its $1 peg, and fell to as low as 87 cents at one point. Despite the brief loss in confidence, Disparte said USDC performed during the crisis. And he highlighted how a research report on the stabelcoin\u2019s management structure underscores the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. At the same time, Circle is hoping to win over hearts and wallets by showcasing its regulatory commitments. The firm made a splash in France after winning a conditional operational license in December. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be on the edge of being regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be regulated in Europe. In Asian markets, from Singapore to Hong Kong to Japan, it\u2019s a similar set of arguments.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be an offshore or nearshore crypto operator like FTX was to the Bahamas to the United States.\u201d Liam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

                "keypoints": "New stablecoin creation in accelerating.\nTether's USDT has lead the inflows over the past week, adding 2.4 billion to its supply.\nSmaller stablecoins, such as First Digital USD and Ethena USDe, are also proving popular.",
                "body": " The supply of stablecoins circulating on blockchains is increasing, with investors adding $4.2 billion worth of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies since the start of the month. April 2 was the biggest day for stablecoin inflows with $1.38 billion worth added, data from DefiLlama shows. It\u2019s the biggest single-day increase since March 11 2023. The rate of new stablecoin creation is now at its highest level since early 2022, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. Stablecoins, such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, are created and issued by centralised firms. An investor can send a stablecoin issuer US dollars through the traditional banking system and receive an equivalent amount of stablecoins onchain. While USDT and USDC operate like this, there are other ways to create stablecoins. DeFi protocols like Ethena allow registered users to deposit assets such as Lido staked Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to create the protocol\u2019s USDe stablecoin. Increases in the stablecoin supply are often viewed as a bullish signal. This is because investors usually create new stablecoins as a starting point to buy other cryptocurrencies, or to use in DeFi. Of the $4.2 billion worth of new stablecoins created so far in April, 2.4 billion were from Tether. It\u2019s currently the biggest stablecoin issuer with over 107 billion of its USDT stablecoin in circulation. The majority of the new USDT were issued on Tron. The network now accounts for over 56 billion USDT. Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin with 31.9 billion in circulation remained comparatively flat, adding just 0.7% to its circulating supply. The recent disparity between USDT and USDC is representative of a longer-running trend. In July 2022, USDC came close to overtaking USDT, after the latter briefly slipped below its dollar peg. But USDT was able to recover. Ever since then, the gap between the top two stablecoins has widened. Amid the sector wide increase, two stablecoins in particular have stood out. First Digital USD, a centralised stablecoin similar to USDC and USDT, grew its circulating supply by $1 billion since the start of the month, a 42% increase. So-called launchpools on crypto exchange Binance are one of the main contributors to the success of First Digital USD \u2014 or FDUSD. Binance lets users deposit FDUSD and BNB into its launchpools to receive an allocation of newly launched tokens. The most recent launchpool was for the Saga blockchain. According to the Binance website, users have deposited more than $2.8 billion FDUSD into the Saga launchpool. The increased demand for stablecoins is also showing in Ethena Labs\u2019 flagship product USDe. Ethena users have created 620 million USDe since the start of the month, bringing the total number of USDe in circulation to almost $2.2 billion. USDe is different from centralised dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies like USDT. Instead of holding dollars or dollar-equivalent assets like Treasury bills to back its stablecoin, Ethena uses futures contracts. Users can deposit Ether to the Ethena protocol to create USDe roughly equivalent to the value of the Ether at the time of the deposit. When users deposit Ether, Ethena takes out a short position \u2014 a bearish bet \u2014 on an equivalent amount of Ether to the user\u2019s deposit. This creates what\u2019s called a delta-neutral position \u2014 meaning that its value should remain constant regardless of if the price of Ether rises or falls. At the same time, USDe holders can stake it to earn yield from the funding rate from Ethena\u2019s short positions and staking yield from deposited Ether. Users can currently earn a 37% yearly return on USDe by staking it. Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent. Reach out with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Stablecoin giant elbowed its way into Bitcoin mining with plants in Latin America.\n'We are first focusing on building renewable energy stations,' Ardoino told DL News.\nTether is taking advantage of concentration of the sector in the US.",
                "body": " In a move that may shake up the global Bitcoin mining industry, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin issuer\u2019s $500 million buildout in the sector is nearly complete. Speaking with DL News on the sidelines of the Paris Blockchain Week, Ardoino said the capital investment has financed construction of mining facilities and energy stations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \u201cIn El Salvador, there is a set-up phase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are first focusing on building renewable energy stations. Starting from solar and wind, and then moving towards geothermal.\u201d In June 2023, Tether said it was participating in a $1 billion initiative in El Salvador to capture the country\u2019s geothermal energy production. \u201cVolcano energy\u201d is expected to power a 241 megawatt energy station, which in turn will help run Bitcoin mining rigs. Tether manages the industry\u2019s largest cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar, USDT. With more than $107 billion worth of coins issued, USDT is the largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ether. Tether first announced its ambitions to enter the mining business, a vastly different niche from stablecoins, last November. The reason for the move into mining? Decentralisation, says Ardoino. \u201cBitcoin mining was first centralised in China and now it\u2019s centralised in the US,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cOf course, the US is more open than China, but we shouldn\u2019t allow one single geopolitical jurisdiction to be so important.\u201d China, with its vast amounts of cheap energy, was home to the majority of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computer power that backs the Bitcoin network. Beijiing banned the activity in 2021 and spurred an exodus to the US. Local governments in Kentucky and Texas attracted mining firms with lucrative tax rebates and energy deals. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for Bitcoin. We need more diversity,\u201d said Ardoino, who was the chief technology officer at Bitfinex before taking the same role at Tether in December 2017. He was appointed Tether CEO in October. The $500 million investment in the mining industry comes just two weeks before Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event. Every four years, the reward doled out to miners every 10 minutes for maintaining the blockchain is slashed in half. This time around it will drop to 3.125 Bitcoin. It\u2019s an unsteady moment for most miners, because while their operational costs remain the same, their main revenue stream is halved. The least efficient operations are expected to suffer from the crunch, while major companies like Marathon Digital have signalled they are looking to acquire distressed assets. The previous halvings have, however, been an enormous boon for the price of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency rose more than 600% in the months after the 2020 halving.

                "headline": "ZkLink looks to solve Ethereum\u2019s fragmented liquidity with a layer 3 \u2014 but there are risks",
                "keypoints": "Insights and expert analysis\nWhat's coming next in crypto\nDeFi trends that matter",
                "body": " Layer 2 blockchains have helped scale Ethereum, bringing transaction costs down to cents compared to those on the main Ethereum network. But despite their successes, layer 2s have created a new problem called liquidity fragmentation \u2014 the splitting up of once-concentrated capital across multiple separate blockchains. Liquidity fragmentation poses several problems. Smaller, unconnected pools of capital spurs volatility and means users get worse prices on their trades. ZkLink is one project working to solve liquidity fragmentation on Ethereum. It has created a so-called layer 3 network \u2014 zkLink Nova \u2014 which is connected to eight Ethereum layer 2s. zkLink has launched MergeToken on Nova, which is a smart contract that consolidates assets \u2014 bridged from layer 2s to Nova and of equivalent value \u2014 into a single token. \u201cWe\u2019re setting the precedent for a practice that we hope more projects will adopt to make the web3 trading environment friendlier,\u201d said Vince Yang, CEO and co-founder of zkLink. Before layer 2s, as well as other blockchains like Solana, Ethereum hosted the lion\u2019s share of onchain activity, pushing the network to $102 billion worth of DeFi deposits in 2021. But in recent years, onchain activity is increasingly moving to layer 2s \u2014 separate networks built on top of Ethereum that offer faster and cheaper transactions. Much of Ethereum\u2019s vast capital has jumped ship, flowing to layer 2s like Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, among others. MergeToken will initially merge versions of stablecoins USDC, USDT and DAI, followed by Wrapped Bitcoin and Ethereum liquid staking tokens in the future. The hope is that by reunifying Ethereum\u2019s scattered liquidity on its layer 3, zkLink can increase capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem and provide a better user experience and trade prices. But there are also risks. In order to make zkLink\u2019s plan work, users must bridge their assets from other layer 2 blockchains to Nova, then lock them up in an upgradable smart contract controlled by a multi-signature wallet \u2014 a crypto wallet that requires multiple password-like private keys to send transactions. This system creates a big pool of assets that can become a lucrative target for hackers. In 2022, the Ronin crypto bridge, which also kept assets in a multi-signature wallet, was hacked for $624 million after the private keys that controlled it were compromised. Yang told DL News there are 3 external vulnerabilities zkLink attempts to protect its users from: bridge contract risk, MergeToken smart contract risk and governance risk. Both the bridge contract and the MergeToken contract lock up assets in single places \u2014 like bank vaults filled with gold bars. And like such bank vaults, which before the advent of digital money were all too often a target of thieves, these smart contracts that hold millions of dollars worth of crypto have also become lucrative targets. Hackers have previously used social engineering techniques to steal the private keys that control smart contracts, while others have used code exploits to trick contracts into giving them their contents. Yang said zkLink\u2019s contracts have been audited by its security partners, ABDK and Secure3. He also said that the multi-signature wallet that controls the MergeToken smart contract is tied to a governance committee made up of multiple projects separate from zkLink. A governance committee made up of 12 projects and institutions, including market maker Wintermute and venture capital firm Ascensive Assets, will oversee all current and future merger proposals. ZkLink said upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract require a two-thirds vote from committee members. Upgrades will also be only executed after a seven-day timelock period, giving the committee and users time to review the changes to the contracts. Certain tokens, such as Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, are not always equal across different layer 2s. When a user sends USDC to Nova, it is represented as a different asset depending on which layer 2 blockchain it came from. ZkLink Nova offers the same faster and cheaper transactions by using zero-knowledge proofs, the same technology that underpins layer 2s like zkSync and Starknet. But it also reunites liquidity split among several different versions of the same assets issued across the ever-growing list of layer 2s. But the boons of reunifying liquidity are only accessible to those on Nova, Yang told DL News. \u201cThe MergeToken is a function unique to Nova and dApps built on Nova can access the aggregated liquidity pool,\u201d he said. DeFi users will have to look to other projects, such as cross-chain bridge and messaging projects like Wormhole, Axelar and LayerZero to break down the barriers between separate blockchains once and for all. But for now, zkLink\u2019s offers one of the first available solutions to liquidity fragmentation that users and developers can start playing around with. Update, April 8: Added that upgrades to the MergeToken smart contract will only be executed after a seven-day timelock period, and clarified that zkLink\u2019s bridge contract and MergeToken contract lock up assets in different places.
