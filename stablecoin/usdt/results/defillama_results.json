                "headline": "Stablecoin supply jumps to $146bn, biggest since FTX collapse",
                "keypoints": "The stablecoin market capitalisation rebounded to $146 billion, marking a $20 billion increase since August.\nTether's USDT led the growth, surpassing $100 billion in supply.\nNew stablecoins like Ethena's USDe and Curve's crvUSD have emerged, offering high yields and innovative features.",
                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "headline": "Binance financial crime head held in a \u2018guest house\u2019 in Nigeria for two weeks",
                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Nigerians can no longer trade crypto for naira on Binance.\nThe crypto exchange has come under scrutiny from multiple Nigerian authorities in last month.",
                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Nigeria probes Binance for facilitating terror finance and money laundering as two executives remain detained",
                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "keypoints": "JPMorgan warned clients against risks of using the Tether stablecoin, again.\nThe investment bank addressed client questions following a note from early February that accused Tether of a lack of transparency and regulatory compliance.\nTether slammed the note as \u201chypocritical\u201d in comments to DL News.",
                "body": " JPMorgan\u2019s clients have burning questions about Tether. The investment bank addressed clients\u2019 inquiries in a critical note on Thursday. Specifically, who uses it, the regulatory risks associated with it, and what impending regulation means for the multi-billion dollar stablecoin. Tether rejected the criticism, labelling it as \u201chypocritical\u201d in messages to DL News. Tether is at risk from regulatory changes, both domestically and abroad, according to JPMorgan. Clients raised several questions after JPMorgan\u2019s earlier February note cited alleged systemic risks related to Tether\u2019s stablecoin \u2014 namely that Tether\u2019s growing dominance was bad for both the crypto and stablecoin markets. \u201cWho uses Tether? The Tether user base looks rather diverse across both centralised and decentralised space,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote, addressing client inquiries. That includes entities operating both within and outside the US, the investment bank said. Much of Tether\u2019s user base \u201cresides offshore in less stringent regulation jurisdictions beyond the direct reach of US regulators,\u201d the bank said. The investment bank cited a recent United Nation\u2019s report that \u201csuggests USDT has become a prominent payment method for money laundering and scams in Southeast Asia.\u201d Tether kicked back at JPMorgan\u2019s latest report. Tether is \u201cproud\u201d of its collaboration with law enforcement, particularly in the US, to curb the illicit use of stablecoins, the stablecoin issuer told DL News via email. \u201cThese hypocritical attacks from the world\u2019s biggest bank suggest JPMorgan\u2019s jealousy over missing the boat on Bitcoin and stablecoins,\u201d Tether said. \u201cPerhaps instead of obsessing over Tether\u2019s market dominance, JPMorgan could address their own practices that have led to them paying nearly $40 billion in fines for banking, securities and other violations.\u201d Tether cited a violation tracker that claims JPMorgan has been fined a total of $39.34 billion on 275 separate occasions between 2000 and 2024, when asked to clarify its remarks by DL News. JPMorgan declined to respond to Tether\u2019s comment. New regulations and the ability to sanction Tether\u2019s offshore usage were also at the top of clients\u2019 minds. \u201cCan US regulators exert control on Tether\u2019s offshore usage?,\u201d clients of JPMorgan asked. \u201cUS regulators can exert some control on Tether\u2019s offshore usage via OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control), which applies to foreign entities whose activities are related to the US financial system,\u201d JPMorgan said. Tether\u2019s association with the crypto mixer Tornado Cash \u2014 which OFAC sanctioned in August 2022 \u2014 is an example of how US authorities can exert some control over the stablecoin, according to JPMorgan analysts. Tornado Cash allows users to obscure transactions. The use of Tether via this privacy enhancement tool has \u201creportedly enabled users to anonymise their transactions for illicit activity,\u201d the bank said. \u201cWhile direct legal actions against offshore entities and decentralised firms are complex, indirect measures and international cooperation could potentially hinder the usage of Tether,\u201d JPMorgan said. Stablecoin regulations are an example of this, the bank added. Regulations are planned to be \u201ccoordinated globally via the Financial Stability Board (FSB) across the G20, further constraining the usage of unregulated stablecoins such as Tether,\u201d JPMorgan wrote. Regulations in the US and in Europe, slated for later this year, will address concerns over issuers, reserves, liquidity and stability, the investment bank said. \u201cUpcoming stablecoin regulations would likely put indirect pressure on Tether as its attractiveness would diminish relative to stablecoins with more transparency and greater compliance,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote. The bank\u2019s analysis comes amid heightened scrutiny in recent months of stablecoins, particularly regarding their role in money laundering, terror financing and regulatory compliance.

Crypto derivatives exchanges Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in an earlier $6 million round led by Dragonfly and Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto exchange BitMEX. Select investors have been able to mint USDe since December. Beginning today, any investor outside the US, Russia, and more than two dozen smaller countries will be able to mint the stablecoin. USDe will try to break into a highly competitive \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 field. Stablecoins are among the most popular real-world applications of crypto technology. They have also been a cash cow for issuers like Tether, who\u2019ve backed their tokens with US Treasuries. Tether posted a net operating profit of more than $6 billion in 2023. Ethena founder Guy Young doesn\u2019t expect USDe to leapfrog Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which have a combined market capitalisation of just under $125 billion. The goal is to create a mass-market stablecoin backed by Ether and versions of staked Ether, rather than real-world assets such as cash and US Treasuries. \u201cWe are definitely not as decentralised as stuff like Liquity,\u201d Young told DL News. \u201c[We\u2019re] not trying to create something that\u2019s perfectly decentralised. What you\u2019re trying to do is just remove collateral from the US banking system and put it into the crypto ecosystem.\u201d Liquity is the company behind the LUSD stablecoin. USDe\u2019s mass-market launch will include integrations with DeFi protocols such as Synthetix, Curve, Convex, and Aave. Other stablecoins, like LUSD and RAI, only accept Ether as collateral. And forthcoming versions of both will accept Ether derivatives like Lido\u2019s stETH. To protect against the volatility of Ether and hold their pegs, existing Ether-backed stablecoins require over-collateralisation: For every $1 of the stablecoin a user borrows, they must deposit more than $1 in Ether. That limits how much a user can borrow and how big the stablecoin can grow. Using a complicated trading strategy, Ethena lets users mint $1 in USDe for about $1.05 worth of Ether. \u2018We basically want to be within the top three stablecoins\u2019 This should create a stablecoin that can expand to a market capitalisation of $5 billion to $10 billion \u2014 much larger than existing Ether-backed competitors, according to Young. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to get as big as something like USDC or USDT, just because there\u2019s natural constraints around how big this product can get, because it relies on the derivative market within crypto being a certain size.\u201d At the same time, it should provide a more decentralised alternative to USDC and USDT, which rely on assets held at banks, which are subject to government oversight and regulation \u2014 in other words, the institutions to which crypto was meant to provide an alternative. \u201cStablecoins are the most important instrument across the entire space,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete joke that DeFi runs literally 100% on centralised stablecoins.\u201d Unlike LUSD or RAI, however, it will rely on old-fashioned businesses for certain functions. Custodians with experience managing crypto, such as Fireblocks and BitGo, have been tapped to hold customer deposits, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s huge centralised components to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Since it became available to some investors in December, USDe\u2019s market capitalisation has topped $225 million, making it one of the 12 largest stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Investors can lock up their USDe to create a yield-bearing token that Ethena has likened to an \u201cinternet bond,\u201d called sUSDe. As of Thursday, the annual yield on sUSDe was a whopping 23%, a figure that recalls the heady days of the Terra stablecoin. Terra imploded in May 2022. Terra\u2019s co-founder, Do Kwon, is currently jailed in Montenegro, awaiting the results of a retrial that could see him extradited to either the US or South Korea. Prosecutors in those countries want to prosecute him for his role in the collapsed ecosystem. Ethena is not an algorithmic stablecoin like Terra. Some of Ethena\u2019s yield comes from staked Ether. As of Thursday, the yield for staking Ether was just under 4% and is expected to fall as more people stake their Ether. The rest comes from the trading strategy that helps keep USDe at peg: Opening short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely cyclical through the market cycles,\u201d Young said of the yield. At the bottom of a bear market, it would likely be near zero, as in 2022. \u201cAnd then it gets pretty crazy, to 20% to 30% when things are properly heated.\u201d He said that he expects this to remain a competitive advantage over other stablecoins. \u201cThe lesson that we got from Anchor\u2026 was, the demand for $1 which can return higher yield than the rest of the market by a few hundred basis points is not a billion dollars. It\u2019s like 20 [billion],\u201d he said, referring to the Terra-affiliated protocol that generated the failed stablecoin\u2019s now-infamous 20% yield. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much risk was sitting there within Terra and Anchor, $20 billion went in there because there was a slightly higher yield.\u201d Correction: Ethena corrected its announcement to remove Franklin Templeton and PayPal Ventures, which are not participating in the funding round, and to clarify that Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, Gemini, and Kraken participated in the company\u2019s previous fund raise. Correction: Ethena also clarified that the Brevan Howard deal has not yet closed. Aleks Gilbert is a New York based reporter covering DeFi. Got a tip? Email him at aleks@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "A new Fidelity report says 2024 could be the year institutions dip their toes in DeFi.\nA combination of rate cuts and increased stablecoin yields in DeFi could be enough to make it worth their while.",
                "body": " A new report from Fidelity says institutions could finally make the leap into DeFi in 2024 as yields start to rise. The report, which covers the asset manager\u2019s 2024 outlook for the crypto industry, focuses on several key areas of development, including Bitcoin mining, stablecoins \u2014 and DeFi. \u201cThere may be renewed interest in 2024 if DeFi yields once again become more attractive than TradFi yields and more developed infrastructure emerges,\u201d the report said. TradFi, or traditional finance, refers to finance beyond crypto \u2014 big banks, asset managers, hedge funds, and so on. The prediction comes as the yields DeFi investors can earn by lending out their stablecoins surpasses the yields on US Treasuries. Fidelity acknowledged that the firm\u2019s 2023 prediction that institutional investors would start meaningfully engaging with DeFi didn\u2019t pan out. It said that in last year\u2019s \u201cprevailing risk-off environment, institutions deemed the mid-single digit returns offered by DeFi yield to be too low for the associated risk.\u201d The report added that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to increase interest rates in 2023 provided institutions with better, or at least perceived to be safer, options. Throughout 2023, dollar-pegged stablecoins took a hit as DeFi investors moved into US Treasuries to earn higher yields. But, if the Fed lowers interest rates by 0.75% by the end of 2024 as forecast, institutions might start looking for more lucrative \u2014 but also riskier \u2014 ways to make more money, like investing in DeFi. The Boston-based financial group, which has $4.5 trillion of assets under management, controls some $4.25 billion worth of Bitcoin through its spot ETF. In DeFi, the yield investors can earn typically increases as the appetite for risk increases. DeFi lending protocols like Aave, the biggest of its kind with over $8.3 billion of deposits, offer an easy way for investors to leverage their crypto holdings. But to do so, other investors must deposit assets \u2014 namely stablecoins \u2014 for them to borrow. In recent months, the yields Aave users can earn by lending out their stablecoins have surpassed the 10-year US Treasuries rate. The 10-year US rate, commonly referred to as the risk-free rate for dollar investments, currently sits at around 4.3%. In DeFi, investors can earn up to 14% on USDT, the biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin in DeFi with over $97 billion in circulation. That\u2019s increased from around 5% in August. Other stablecoins are also commanding higher yields. Dai, the third-biggest stablecoin with around $4.8 billion in circulation, earns Aave depositors around 8.5%, while Circle\u2019s USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin, earns just under 5%. DeFi investors usually view the lending rates offered on DeFi stablecoins through lending protocols like Aave as the sector\u2019s own risk-free rate. That\u2019s because it represents the baseline return against which all other DeFi positions are evaluated. The rates offered to lenders on Aave are decided by the protocol\u2019s algorithms. Yields increase in line with how popular an asset is with borrowers. It\u2019s high yields like these that could tempt institutions into DeFi if and when the yields on US Treasuries fall. And as long as the appetite for risk continues, the enticing yields that DeFi investors can achieve through lending stablecoins are unlikely to diminish in the near future.

                "headline": "Binance users in the Philipines take 7% haircut on USDT following regulators ban",
                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "headline": "Solana projects set to challenge Circle and Tether dominance in $3 billion stablecoin market",
                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "headline": "Binance financial crime head held in a \u2018guest house\u2019 in Nigeria for two weeks",
                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "keypoints": "Nigerians can no longer trade crypto for naira on Binance.\nThe crypto exchange has come under scrutiny from multiple Nigerian authorities in last month.",
                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "headline": "Scrap the digital euro, or at least build on blockchain: lawmakers in EU draft bill",
                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "headline": "Tron says USDC\u2019s exit was due to lack of demand \u2014 but Circle cites \u2018risk management\u2019",
                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Nigerian officials demand Binance produce customer data as investigation intensifies.\nCrypto users are turning to the black market to make trades.\nNigerian authorities may be following playbook of US prosecutors.",
                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Stablecoins hit $1 trillion in trading volume in January across centralised exchanges.\nThe sector\u2019s market value rose to $138 billion in February \u2014 still $49 billion less than its peak in May 2022.\nNot all stablecoins benefited from the rising tide equally.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "keypoints": "The Curve DAO has about $290,000 in unclaimed fees, mostly from the Gnosis Chain.\nThe unclaimed fees, once collected, will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders.\nCurve is expanding its revenue streams with a new lending product and with the growth of its stablecoin crvUSD, alongside its traditional trading volume revenue.",
                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.

                "keypoints": "Investors are rushing to withdraw funds after regulators banned exchange.\nCustomers are trying to take their money off the exchange as the ban is enforced.\n'A lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,' said one crypto expert.",
                "body": " Binance users in the Philippines are scrambling to withdraw their money from the crypto exchange as regulators block access to the website. The rush followed an announcement on Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Philippines had formally requested the nation\u2019s telecommunications regulator to block Binance. The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange had drawn the ire of officials by failing to get an operating licence in the Asian nation, where crypto is super popular. As a result, vendors on the Binance P2P marketplace are pricing Tether\u2019s USDT at a 5 to 7% discount as they try to liquidate their inventories, according to screenshots shared with DL News by Luis Buenaventura, an assistant vice president at GCash and the co-founder of crypto exchange platform BloomX. Retail customers are also contending with \u201cmassive\u201d on-chain fees, in some cases more than $12 for trading Bitcoin and any Ethereum base layer tokens, or to move their holdings to other wallets or exchanges. \u201cAll told, a lot of wealth is being destroyed this week,\u201d Buenaventura told DL News. He said customers were also forfeiting earnings in time-locked deposit instruments when taking money off of Binance. The developments mark yet another crisis confronting CEO Richard Teng as he struggles to manage the vulnerabilities of the business model installed by his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao. Binance\u2019s penchant for operating in markets without registering or licencing its services has triggered a conflict with Nigerian authorities, who detained two senior exchange executives in February. In November, the Philippines SEC warned the public against using Binance because it was an unlicenced investment platform. Regulators criticised the exchange for relying on a legion of \u201csalesmen, brokers, dealers or agents, representatives, promoters, recruiters, influencers, endorsers, and enablers\u201d to promote Binance. The SEC said these agents could face up to 21 years in prison and a fine of 5 million pesos ($90,000). Binance has not made any public statements regarding the matter. Binance did not respond to requests for comment from DL News. \u2018The ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for.\u2019 Over the last few months, users in the Philippines have been waiting to see whether a ban would actually take effect. The deadline passed with little fanfare or clarity, and the announcement Monday has come as a shock to many. \u201cThe SEC is aware that Binance represents a major share of the Philippine crypto market, but their execution of the ban does not indicate any strong desire to protect the citizens they are responsible for,\u201d said Buenaventura. \u201cThere should have been regular reminders as well as a widely publicised deadline, but instead we got two press releases four months apart, and very little hard data.\u201d The SEC maintains that it gave people plenty of warning and time to exit the platform in light of the size and volume of Binance\u2019s operations in the country. \u201cThe SEC ensured that the investing public would have enough time to exit the platform and reposition their portfolio in favour of authorised investment products and platforms,\u201d it said. Enforcing the ban is currently in the early stages. Some users are still able to access the site, while others receive either an error message or are redirected to a page bearing the SEC logo and a message that the site is not accessible. One user told DL News that they could access the site while someone else on the same WiFi network was unable to \u2014 though they eventually too started to get an error message. Rafael Padilla, legal director at Farcove Consulting in Manila, said recently he believed that neither the SEC nor the National Telecommunications Commission has the legal authority to order the blocking of Binance\u2019s website. He said blocking Binance\u2019s website while letting local crypto exchanges offer similar products is \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d \u201cIt offends the right to equal protection, incidentally of Binance, but most importantly of Filipino users that SEC ironically wants to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of whom use the platform for non-security related transactions.\u201d He added that other unregistered offshore exchanges could also be the subject of a similar enforcement action by the SEC. As to whether Binance has a future in the Philippines, it\u2019s difficult to say. \u201cIt depends on whether Binance or its Philippines-based users are willing to question the SEC and the NTC\u2019s blocking access order in court,\u201d said Padilla.

                "keypoints": "Solana\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by two centralised tokens, USDC and USDT.\nA pair of Solana projects are working to build crypto-backed alternatives.\nPrevious attempts have failed to gain any traction.",
                "body": " Solana\u2019s \u201cDeFi 2.0\u2033 projects are wading into the popular blockchain\u2019s $3 billion stablecoin market, betting they can succeed where their predecessors have struggled. Mrgn, the company behind year-old lending and liquid staking protocol marginfi, will likely launch a stablecoin with a \u201csoft peg\u201d to the US dollar this month. Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator that launched just before FTX collapsed in November 2022, is also working on a stablecoin, though it has yet to announce a release date. If successful, they\u2019ll crack a duopoly on the lucrative stablecoin market while giving Solana users a crypto-native alternative \u2014 a valued commodity among crypto purists looking for stable, \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d assets. Stablecoins are among the most successful real-world applications of crypto technology, increasingly used to pay for goods and services in some parts of the world, such as Lebanon and Argentina. That\u2019s because they\u2019re meant to be stable \u2014 pegged at all times to another asset, typically the US dollar. That provides a blockchain-based refuge from the volatility of most other tokens. But crypto-backed stablecoins have bedevilled Solana projects. Despite several attempts to create one, almost 70% of the blockchain\u2019s stablecoin market is dominated by Circle\u2019s USDC, according to DefiLlama data. USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, another \u201ccentralised\u201d stablecoin, account for almost 99% of the stablecoin market on Solana. Although both dominate on Ethereum, they face stiffer competition from stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as Maker\u2019s DAI and Ethena\u2019s USDe. Those tokens account for a combined 7% of Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin market. Proponents of decentralisation sometimes champion crypto-backed stablecoins due to their limited exposure to the banking system and, in turn, hostile regulators. Nevertheless, similar projects on Solana have found little success. The three largest, UXD, PAI, and USDH, have a combined circulating supply of just 15 million. Marginfi head of growth Anders Jorgensen attributed USDC\u2019s dominance to Solana\u2019s relatively immature DeFi ecosystem, which is booming after it was levelled by the collapse of FTX in 2022. \u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember is, like, Solana\u2019s still really early,\u201d Jorgensen told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just been a function of, there hasn\u2019t been as many devs as the EVM ecosystem, and the really quality teams have just pursued other primitives so far.\u201d Marginfi\u2019s stablecoin, YBX, will be backed by liquid staking derivatives, such as the company\u2019s own LST and Jito\u2019s JitoSOL. Because the assets that back YBX appreciate in value over time, so too will the token, which is designed to gradually drift away from its \u201csoft\u201d dollar peg. That\u2019s part of the reason the marginfi chose to eschew stablecoin naming conventions. Of the hundreds of dollar-pegged stablecoins in circulation, almost all have \u201cUSD\u201d in their name. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a stablecoin, right?\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a dollar-denominated stake pool. So you\u2019re just getting the yield from staking in dollar terms.\u201d Not everyone loves the design. Messari analyst Kunal Goel has likened YBX to Lybra, an Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by liquid staking derivatives. Lybra\u2019s design \u201cmakes it a good store of value, but it may limit its adoption across DeFi as a medium of exchange,\u201d Goel wrote last year. But Solana\u2019s frothy market and the limited supply of its leading stablecoin, USDC, will ensure its success, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIn the market we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s a ton of demand to get leverage, and so rates are super high,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been quoting anywhere from 20 [percent] to high double-digits to borrow USDC on marginfi.\u201d Just after 4:30pm New York time Thursday, the cost to borrow USDC on marginfi, Kamino, and Solend \u2014 all Solana lending protocols \u2014 was 26%, 29%, and 20%, respectively. Marginfi users who loan liquid staking tokens will be able to mint YBX for far less: Mrgn plans on charging an interest rate of about 2%, according to Jorgensen. \u201cIf you can get leverage for that cheap, which is what we\u2019re going to offer with YBX, I think there\u2019s a very clear incentive to mint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

                "headline": "Why Bitcoin can\u2019t pose a threat to the global order, according to new research",
                "keypoints": "A new peer-reviewed study finds that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose less of a threat to the global political economy than previously thought.\nThe finding bucks the view of crypto an a global financial disruptor.\nSome cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help boost US monetary power.",
                "body": " A new study published by academics at the University of Missouri argues that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are less of a threat to the international political and economic status quo than previously thought. Cryptocurrencies were once heralded as a way to disrupt the world\u2019s financial systems. But according to researchers Heather-Leigh Ba and \u00d6mer Faruk \u015een, crypto doesn\u2019t really pose a threat to the global political economy, as countries opposed to US dominance are also more likely to ban it. The study, published in scholarly journal Review of International Political Economy on March 15, looked at what factors influence a country\u2019s decision to ban or limit its citizen\u2019s access to cryptocurrency. \u201cOur cross-national analysis does not find a statistically significant relationship between currency crises and the likelihood of governments enacting cryptocurrency bans,\u201d \u015een told DL News. \u201cThis suggests that national cryptocurrency regulations do not appear to be motivated by a country\u2019s recent experiences with currency crises.\u201d Instead, they found that countries with more stringent economic controls were more likely to restrict or ban cryptocurrencies because they pose a threat to their economic stability. But it\u2019s these countries that many thought could use crypto as a way to gain an edge against the world\u2019s leading economies, namely the US. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest rivals, those countries that might be inclined to promote crypto as a way of undermining American financial and monetary power, are autocratic and employ exchange rate and capital controls,\u201d the study said. \u201cThey are thus constrained in their ability to promote cryptocurrency for these ends.\u201d With this being the case, greater global crypto adoption should weaken such smaller economies who cannot or will not adopt it. At the same time, crypto may do little to disrupt the US\u2019 position as the dominant world monetary power. Certain cryptocurrencies, such as US dollar stablecoins, may even help bolster the US\u2019 monetary power. \u201cOur results suggest that cryptocurrency threatens the international political and economic status quo less than many speculate because regimes most likely to be at odds with US monetary and financial dominance face a strong incentive to ban the technologies in their own countries,\u201d the study said. Co-authors of the study, Ba and \u015een, identified three factors that might make a country more likely to ban or restrict crypto use: countries that fix their currency\u2019s exchange rate, those with authoritarian regimes, and those that impose capital controls on their citizens. Capital controls are actions taken by a government to limit the flow of capital in and out of an economy. Cryptocurrencies allow users to send funds permissionlessly across borders and can easily bypass such controls. Crypto can also bypass official fixed exchange rates, impacting the value of a country\u2019s native currency. The authors hypothesised that countries that are more authoritarian, or those that impose a fixed currency exchange rate or capital controls, are more likely to ban crypto, while countries that do not will have less incentive to ban them. The results support their idea. They found that countries with such economic controls were more likely to ban or restrict crypto use. The authors found that the evidence suggests decisions to regulate crypto are \u201clargely motivated by governments\u2019 very practical concerns over monetary and political control,\u201d and not its potential to disrupt the current financial system. \u201cConcerns about the threat of cryptocurrency to US dollar hegemony and financial power are exaggerated,\u201d the authors said. In addition to negatively impacting countries that might otherwise promote cryptocurrencies to undermine American financial power, they may also help boost US dollar dominance. One way in which they do so is through US dollar stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. Demand for such stablecoins is growing, especially in countries with unstable economies like Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye. Ba told DL News that stablecoins can boost US monetary power similarly to off-shore dollar markets \u2014 where non-US residents use the US dollar to settle trade and make investments, without going through the US financial system. Examples of such markets are commonplace in countries with ailing economies. In Argentina, which has suffered from 211% inflation of the Argentine Peso in 2023, many turn to informal currency markets where they can buy what they call \u201cblue dollars\u201d \u2014 US greenbacks \u2014 for almost three times the official rate. Lebanon, another country rocked by high inflation, has similar markets, many of which rely on Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. These countries also register higher than average levels of crypto adoption. According to \u015een, such crypto adoption is a symptom of financial mismanagement. The existence of these markets is only a good thing for the US, Ba said. \u201cUS monetary power does boil down to supply and demand for the US dollar, which logically would mean stablecoins contribute to US monetary power.\u201d With economies that might otherwise use cryptocurrencies to challenge the US banning them, and stablecoins helping to solidify the US dollar\u2019s status as the world reserve currency, crypto is looking less and less like the disruptor many thought it would be.

                "body": " Since a low in August, the total stablecoin market capitalisation has bounced back, rising by $20 billion to $146 billion. This recovery marks a turnaround after the market faced considerable hurdles over the past couple of years. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar, to minimise price volatility. An increase in the stablecoin market capitalisation is considered to have a positive impact on the crypto markets as it indicates new money entering the system. The biggest contributor to this growth is Tether\u2019s USDT. Tether was able to increase its total supply by over 52% since August, surpassing $100 billion in total circulating supply on March 5. Tether has said it is solvent and functioning as expected, according to its own attestation. But it has faced questions regarding whether it\u2019s properly maintaining the funds to back the USDT stablecoin. Still, some users believe that the increase in USDT\u2019s supply was a result of its resilience over the last bear market, with the stablecoin maintaining its peg through serious market turbulence. Coming onto the scene recently is Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar stablecoin USDe, exploding from under $5m in total circulating supply on December 10 to over $978 million today. Ethena has a strong crypto native backing but also offers users significant yields on stablecoin deposits. Ethena lets users mint USDe with about $1 in Ether, when typically stablecoins are over-collateralized. It also offers users a high yield on USDe deposits, currently just over a 67% annual percentage yield, in addition to a points campaign. Points are given out by projects to users for interacting with a protocol, and are generally converted to tokens at a later date. Popular decentralised exchange, Curve Finance, also launched a stablecoin in May of 2023, dubbed crvUSD. Since launching, the stablecoin has grown dramatically, just breaking an all-time high in circulating supply of $164 million on March 8. The stablecoin from Curve uses a novel \u201csoft liquidation\u201d mechanism that is designed to reduce losses for users borrowing in volatile market conditions.

                "keypoints": "Tigran Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla were detained amid dispute with crypto exchange.\nBinance says it is working 'collaboratively' with Nigerian officials to free them.\nExecutives were trying to resolve dispute in African nation when they were placed in custody.",
                "body": " Binance\u2019s head of financial crime compliance is one of the two executives detained by Nigerian authorities since late February. Tigran Gambaryan, a former special agent in the US Internal Revenue Service and a top financial crimes executive at Binance since 2021, is being held at a \u201cguest house\u201d owned by the state, according to a senior security official familiar with the case. The other Binance executive is Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British lawyer and Kenya-based manager for the global crypto exchange, the official told DL News. Both executives flew into the country to meet with finance and law enforcement officials in connection with a dispute over Binance\u2019s impact on the African nation\u2019s currency, the naira. The two men were detained after talks broke down and they were escorted to their hotel and directed to surrender their passports and move to a residence under guard, sources told DL News. DL News first reported the news of the two executives\u2019 detainment on February 28. Wired magazine reported their identities on Tuesday. Authorities have blamed Binance, which operates in the nation without a licence, for contributing to the steep devaluation of the naira in the last year, and for facilitating the inflow of $26 billion in illicit funding. In an email to DL News, Binance confirmed the identities of its two executives. \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201d Binance said. \u201cThey are professionals with the highest integrity and we will provide them with all the support we can. We trust there will be a swift resolution to this matter.\u201d Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have not been charged with a crime even though about two weeks have passed since they were taken into custody by the Department of State Security under the orders of the Office of the National Security Adviser. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have also not been summoned for a public court hearing, and the Nigerian government has not officially identified them or issued a detailed statement on the matter. The two Binance executives are being held in a facility run by the country\u2019s Office of the National Security Adviser. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency \u2014 is spearheading the investigation. The commission secured an order from an Abuja High Court to keep the Binance executives in custody. Tensions have been building between Binance and the Central Bank of Nigeria and other state departments for months. As it does in many markets, Binance operates without a licence in Nigeria and depends on brokers, agents, and other salespeople to attract local investors to its online crypto exchange. In nations with volatile currencies such as Nigeria and Lebanon, households and businesses have flocked to Binance to preserve their wealth by converting fiat into stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Now this unorthodox model is backfiring as regulators demand the exchange comply with the same types of registration and licencing requirements governing other financial firms. The Philippines is asking Binance to get registered or be blocked from operating in the nation. In Nigeria, the picture has become even more complicated as officials race to defend the falling naira from further devaluation by alleged currency speculators. Binance has been caught in the middle of this campaign when authorities accused it of enabling currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. A legislative committee has been investigating Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria over the last three years. These proceedings only became public recently. Binance, meanwhile, has removed trading of Nigeria\u2019s naira from its platform. Users cannot deposit naira to buy other cryptocurrencies or withdraw naira from the exchange. The platform is also not accessible to Nigerians unless they use a VPN service. That\u2019s because Nigerian authorities ordered internet service providers to block access to the Binance website.

                "body": " Binance has removed every avenue for trading Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, for other cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a blog post by the exchange on Tuesday. Nigerians can no longer user Binance as an onramp to deposit their naira on the exchange or to buy other crypto, including Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin. In addition, investors cannot exchange USDT for naira and withdraw the currency to their local bank accounts. Binance\u2019s delisting of the naira also covers its peer-to-peer trading platform, which was popular among Nigeria\u2019s buoyant crypto population. Users have until Friday to convert their naira balances on the exchange to other stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT. Those who fail to do so will have their balances automatically converted to USDT once the deadline passes, Binance said in its blog. Binance did not state any reason for delisting the naira from its platform. Yet the move comes after a tumultuous two weeks for the exchange in Nigeria where government officials blamed Binance for facilitating currency speculation and foreign exchange manipulation. Nigeria\u2019s top intelligence agency detained at least two Binance officials last week amid an interagency investigation into the exchange. Officials close to the investigation previously told DL News the government was investigating allegations of illicit flows through Binance. The country\u2019s telecoms regulator has also blocked access to Binance with Nigerians having to rely on VPN services to move their funds out of the exchange. With today\u2019s decision, Binance is no longer a so-called crypto bank for Nigerians that allowed them to trade crypto using their local currency easily. Instead, Nigeria\u2019s savvy crypto population which transacted $60 billion in stablecoin trades between 2021 and 2023 will now have to look for crypto trading platform alternatives.

                "keypoints": "One lawmaker suggested scratching the whole digital euro proposal, according to amendments to the digital euro bill from lawmakers.\nSome lawmakers think the digital euro would be more valuable if built on blockchain.\nThe European Central Bank is experimenting with distributed ledgers.",
                "body": " Some lawmakers in the European Parliament want to scrap a bill on the digital euro. And others are betting that the widely criticised project will become more relevant if it\u2019s powered by distributed ledger technology. Right-wing Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen proposed an amendment to scrap the legislation, according to amendments parliamentarians submitted on the digital euro bill. \u201cI seriously still doubt whether there is any added value for digital euro in the market today,\u201d Hoogeveen, who has been a vocal critic, said in a recent European Parliament meeting with a European Central Bank executive. Still, Hoogeveen also submitted amendments proposing the ECB adopt blockchain for the digital euro\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cTo be truly innovative and bring value to European businesses and consumers, the digital euro could be built on blockchain,\u201d Hoogeveen wrote in an amendment. He added in an additional amendment that using blockchain would serve fintechs and startups, which could help spark innovation. Europe\u2019s Frankfurt-based central bank has boosted its digital euro project, and it is currently seeking private partners to develop the digital euro with contracts totalling over a billion euros. These are on hold until legislation is completed. Lawmakers like Hoogeveen have struggled to understand the value of a retail central bank digital currency, given that digital payments already function effectively. Still, digital euro proponents argue that it will help Europe regain sovereignty over payments, which are currently dominated by foreign companies, including Visa and Mastercard. What the digitised version of cash will have to offer is now in the hands of lawmakers negotiating its legal guardrails. The Parliament\u2019s committee for economic affairs has just a few weeks to complete its work on the digital euro legislation, with a vote scheduled for April 8. The European Parliament may be betting on blockchain for solutions to conditional payments, \u201cwhere smart contracts could trigger payments in the digital euro,\u201d said Jonas Gross, chair of the Digital Euro Association and COO of etonec, a crypto payments platform. \u201cThese use cases are highly relevant for the industry to leverage benefits of DLT such as composability, automation, and enable novel use cases,\u201d Gross told DL News. Other parliamentarians submitted amendments in a similar vein, pushing for a DLT-based digital euro, according to the draft report dated 21 February. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right lawmaker, proposed that two years after the legislation goes live, the European Commission would need to assess and report on \u201cthe possibility for tokenisation of the digital euro and its usability for distributed ledger applications.\u201d Alfred Sant, a left-wing lawmaker from Malta, added an amendment calling on the ECB to consider adopting \u201cstandards\u201d that would allow the digital euro to be \u201creferenced\u201d on distributed ledgers. The member of the European Parliament appointed to lead digital euro negotiations has already amended the bill. That\u2019s Stefan Berger, a German, centre-right MEP who also led negotiations on Europe\u2019s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. In his report published in early February, he added an amendment saying that \u201cconditional payments in [digital euros] may also be carried out on permissionless distributed ledgers.\u201d Berger added that until now, these kinds of ledgers are only used in payments by privately issued crypto assets. If the ECB approves, the digital euro would then be available on public blockchains. Gross said: \u201cOne way to provide such a solution is to issue the digital euro on permissionless DLT such as Ethereum. So, where today stablecoins like [Circle\u2019s] USDC or [Tether\u2019s] USDT are present, in the future there could also be a digital euro token.\u201d The original proposal for the digital euro drafted by the European Commission, published in June, made little mention of DLT. It said only that the digital euro settlement infrastructure should be adaptable to new tech, \u201cincluding distributed ledger technology.\u201d \u201cTo date, the ECB was hesitant to issue central bank money on a permissionless DLT,\u201d Gross said. This became clear in the work on wholesale CBCD, he added. It will be interesting to see how the Parliament\u2019s push towards innovation will be accepted as negotiations among European lawmakers continue, he added. The ECB said in an FAQ updated earlier in February that it is \u201cexperimenting\u201d with distributed ledger technologies for the digital euro, but has not made a decision. Have a tip about CBDCs?

                "keypoints": "Tron says Circle's withdrawal from the Tron blockchain was due to a lack of demand for USDC.\nCircle says it was due to \"risk management\u201d since it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d",
                "body": " On February 20, USDC provider Circle announced it was discontinuing support for its USDC stablecoin on the Tron blockchain, citing its \u201crisk management\u201d and saying it wants to \u201censure that USDC remains trusted, transparent and safe.\u201d But Tron sees things differently. Feroz Lakhani, a senior partnerships manager for TRON DAO, told DL News that he believes Circle withdrew from Tron because of a lack of demand for USDC. Lakhani recalled a conversation he had with Circle early last year when Circle was considering adding the Tron blockchain to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol \u2014 CCTP \u2014 a protocol that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains. \u201cThe one question I got, which is very valid, was, \u2018How big is the demand for CCTP on Tron? Like how badly do your developers want it?,\u2019\u201d he said. Lakhani said that after a lukewarm response from Tron developers, Circle cooled on working on the integration. \u201cThey were like, \u2018if you don\u2019t see the demand, I don\u2019t really see a reason to put in that much effort,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the response that I got last when I talked to them.\u201d A spokesperson for Circle told DL News the firm had nothing to add on the matter beyond what was already stated in its public announcement. Since Tron launched in May 2018, USDC has struggled to compete against Tether\u2019s USDT, the dominant stablecoin on the Tron blockchain. There is now more than $50 billion worth of USDT on Tron, compared with just $250 million of USDC. But at the same time, Tron founder Justin Sun faces legal challenges in the US. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Sun with charges of fraud and wash-trading. Sun has said the SEC suit \u201clacks merit.\u201d Much of Tron\u2019s success is because it was one of the first blockchains to give people in countries with volatile currencies the ability to invest in US dollars. But Tron can\u2019t do that alone. It needs companies like Circle and Tether to issue US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron for its users to hold and trade. Early on in Tron\u2019s life, Tether\u2019s USDT established itself as the blockchain\u2019s dominant stablecoin. This early dominance, Lakhani says, is part of the reason USDC has struggled to compete on Tron. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cTether on Tron ain\u2019t broke. It\u2019s been working. It\u2019s been working very well for a long time. And so I feel like that\u2019s the mentality that a lot of people have.\u201d User demand for stablecoins like USDT has pushed Tron and Tether into somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. They depend on each other for their success. USDC\u2019s exit from Tron only adds to Tether\u2019s dominance on the chain, and reduces the options for those looking to hold US dollar-denominated stablecoins on Tron. When asked about the relationship between Tron and Tether, Lakhani said Tron founder Justin Sun had a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the stablecoin provider, but he didn\u2019t know if the relationship was formal or not. Despite Tether\u2019s cooperation with the US Department of Justice and other law-enforcement authorities, a recent United Nations report said USDT was still the \u201cpreferred choice\u201d for $17 billion in Asian crime rackets. Then last month, JPMorgan said in a report that Tether is at risk from a changing regulatory landscape across Europe and the US. When asked if Tron was worried if something were to happen to Tether, Lakhani said he wasn\u2019t concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about just not very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to focus on things that I have no control over and I don\u2019t see any reason currently to stress about.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Nigerian authorities who have detained two Binance executives are investigating whether the crypto exchange is facilitating terrorism financing, money laundering, and other forms of illicit finance, officials told DL News on Thursday. As part of the probe, Nigerian officials are demanding access to details of Binance\u2019s customers in the African nation, sources close to the investigation said. They asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe. The developments indicate that a probe into market manipulation and the potential impact of Binance\u2019s offerings on Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, is expanding. The two executives, an American and a British citizen, were detained on Monday after arriving in the country at the invitation of the government to address questions about its operations, officials told DL News. They have not been publicly identified, and there have been no reports they have been charged. But their situation marks a potentially grave escalation of a long simmering dispute between the Nigerian government and the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange. Binance media representatives did not respond to DL News\u2019 multiple requests for comment. The Binance website is no longer accessible to Nigerians and some users have reported moving their trading activity to alternative platforms like KuCoin and Bybit. \u201cCrypto peer-to-peer trading groups are springing up on Telegram\u201d recently in response, Aliyu Hassan, a crypto merchant, told DL News. Hassan said he averaged $50,000 worth of volume in weekly peer-to-peer trading of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on Binance before the recent ban. He warned that such trading groups on messaging platforms like Telegram were not as safe as exchanges like Binance that offered escrow and mediation. \u2018The government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous.\u2019 Crypto and blockchain advocates like Rume Ophi, executive secretary of the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria, say the government\u2019s measures may force traders to underground channels that cannot be adequately policed. \u201cThe government\u2019s action is empowering the crypto black market and that is dangerous,\u201d Ophi said. DL News could not immediately ascertain if the detained Binance officials were cooperating with the investigation. Sources close to the matter said both Binance employees asked to be released to their embassies in Nigeria. Under a government-approved system, Binance can furnish officials with customer data. That includes transaction history, blockchain data, and personal identification information among other user data categories. Earlier this month, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, ordered internet service providers to block access to Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and other crypto exchange websites. That action came after Binance and other crypto exchanges were accused of aiding and abetting currency speculation and forex market manipulation from several departments in Nigeria\u2019s government. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor Olayemi Cardoso drew attention to funds moving across crypto platforms. \u201cWe are concerned that certain practices go on that indicate illicit flows going through a number of these entities and suspicious flows at best,\u201d Cardoso said at a press conference. \u201cIn the case of Binance, in the last one year alone, $26 billion has passed through \u2018Binance Nigeria\u2019 from sources and users who we cannot adequately identify.\u201d In November, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking law and agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty for failing to prevent terror groups and other sanctioned entities from using the platform to launder and manage their funds. It appears that Nigerian authorities are now developing a similar line of inquiry. Updated on February 29 to report comments by Olayemi Cardoso, the Nigerian central bank governor.

                "keypoints": "Circle, which is planning to IPO, has been a winner from the surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIts stablecoin, USDC, has seen its circulating supply swell 14% from a slump last month.\nWhile USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December.",
                "body": " As Circle prepares to go public, its stablecoin, USDC, is experiencing a \u201cresurgence.\u201d Coinbase institutional research expects the recovery to continue through the remainder of this year. The wider stablecoin market has started to \u201cpick up sharply\u201d since the fourth quarter of 2023, Coinbase institutional research said in a report on Monday. The reason? A boost \u201cin overall crypto demand,\u201d read the report. As investors flocked to crypto markets in anticipation of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds being approved in the US, stablecoin demand also rebounded. Soaring Bitcoin prices have helped lift other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Circle\u2019s USDC has seen its circulating supply jump over 14.2% since the beginning of January. USDC\u2019s circulating supply is now over $27.2 billion, up from $23.8 billion on January 1, according to DefiLlama data. The stablecoin hit a peak of $56 billion in June 2022. The recovery reflects improved liquidity \u2013 or how quickly an asset can be converted into cash \u2013 and usage outside of the USDC outside of the US. USDC\u2019s availability on global exchanges has improved over the past few months, aiding this growth. Circle\u2019s stablecoin has typically been used in the US and Western Europe, while Tether\u2019s USDT is mostly traded in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \u201cIndeed, USDT dominates most other regions due to its early adoption on many international exchanges, which has made it more ubiquitous in offshore crypto trading,\u201d Coinbase said. Coinbase and Circle jointly launched USDC in 2018, rolling out the dollar-pegged token to a wide variety of networks, including Polygon, Solana, and Ethereum. Trading volumes on USDC trading pairs are expanding on centralised exchanges, Coinbase said, \u201calthough they still pale in comparison to USDT-settled trading in spot and perps overall.\u201d While USDC still languishes behind Tether\u2019s USDT, it has outpaced its growth since the beginning of December. USDT is the market\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency by circulating value, commanding $98 billion, more than triple USDC. The total share of spot and derivative trading volumes settled in USDC on centralised exchanges has \u201cincreased sharply from 0.8% at the start of 2023 to 3.9% as of February 15, 2024,\u201d the report said. Change in total volumes on CEXs Change in total volumes on CEXs settled in USDC. (Amberdata/Coinbase) USDC\u2019s share of the perpetual futures, or perps, market has also increased in recent months. Perps are a type of derivative contract predominantly available in crypto. These types of contracts have no settlement date, meaning that they trade in perpetuity and offer investors significantly more leverage to speculate on price moves. Coinbase launched a market maker program for USDC in December, to support its growth within the crypto ecosystem. The program is designed to \u201cimprove order book health\u201d on a range of USDC products including spot and perps, the crypto exchange\u2019s report said. \u201cInitial results suggest that USDC\u2019s share of the perps market has more than tripled between October 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024,\u201d Coinbase said. USDC is still just 2.6% of global perps futures volumes. \u201cThis is still far below USDT\u2019s dominant 84.4% share of perp volumes,\u201d Coinbase added."

                "keypoints": "The market capitalisation of Ethena Labs' \"synthetic dollar,\" USDe, surpassed $400 million less than a week after its worldwide launch.\nThe launch also drew critics, who latched onto USDe's Terra-like yield and Ethena Labs' past use of the word \"stablecoin.\"\nEthena founder Guy Young took to X to address the criticism.",
                "body": " Don\u2019t call it a stablecoin. With its eye-popping yield and novel design, Ethena\u2019s \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, has attracted major investors as it quickly became one of the 10 most popular crypto tokens pegged to the US dollar, with a market capitalisation just over $400 million. But its recent launch has also drawn scrutiny from prominent crypto investors and developers who say it is too risky to be considered a \u201cstablecoin\u201d in the mould of other dollar-pegged tokens, like Circle\u2019s USDC or MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Ethena founder Guy Young agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it explicitly clear that this product does actually look very different to a normal stablecoin,\u201d Young said Thursday on a live online forum in which he addressed recent criticism of USDe. \u201cBut I think we also hear the message that obviously there are certain elements of this where you can immediately start to think that this is a normal stablecoin. So something like the ticker, for example, is not something that we put as much thought into,\u201d he said. Stablecoins are one of the few crypto products to have found consistent use in the real world. Their relatively stable value has served as a blockchain-based refuge for people living in hyperinflationary economies as well as for traders wary of more volatile cryptocurrencies. The debate surrounding USDe has cast a spotlight on the most vexing challenge facing stablecoin developers: how to balance demands for stability, scalability, and an industry obsession with freedom from regulatory oversight \u2014 \u201cdecentralisation\u201d or \u201ccensorship resistance\u201d in crypto parlance. Ahead of its launch, Young told DL News USDe wouldn\u2019t be the most decentralised stablecoin \u2014 or the largest. But it had found a sweet spot. Unlike Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC, which are backed with cash equivalents like US Treasuries, USDe is backed with Ether and Ether derivatives. Unlike with other Ether-backed stablecoins, users can mint USDe with about $1 in Ether. Typically, such stablecoins are over-collateralized. While that limits how large they can grow \u2014 a user can borrow only so much if they need to put up $2 of Ether for every dollar of stablecoin \u2014 it also protects against Ether\u2019s volatility, ensuring the stablecoin is always fully backed. Ethena claims to have effectively solved the over-collateralization requirement with a novel design: It opens short derivatives positions on centralised exchanges to offset the long spot positions represented by users\u2019 deposited assets. In addition to keeping USDe at its peg to the US dollar, this would generate yield that users could tap into by locking up their USDe. Annualised, that yield was just over 24% on Friday. The design would create a dollar-pegged token whose collateral assets were held outside the US banking system, according to Young. Although it would not be perfectly decentralised \u2014 the collateral would be stored with crypto custodians such as Fireblocks for safekeeping \u2014 it would be able to grow far larger than Ether-backed competitors like Liquity\u2019s LUSD. \u201cWe basically want to be within the top three stablecoins,\u201d Young said ahead of its launch. But some said it was too good to be true. \u201cGiven that we saw Terra blow up after offering 20% yield on UST, everyone\u2019s suddenly like, \u2018Oh my God, we just re-invented Terra, it\u2019s a new Ponzi, how can you be offering 27% yield,\u2019\u201d Ethereum influencer and Ethena Labs investor Anthony Sassano said Tuesday on his YouTube show, The Daily Gwei, summarising much of the debate around USDe. The Terra blockchain and its related stablecoin, UST, brought the industry to its knees in 2022 when UST lost its peg to the US dollar. Sceptics had repeatedly warned UST was unstable, but its market capitalization grew to nearly $20 billion because of its promise that holders could earn 20% annualised yield by depositing it in a sister protocol called Anchor. USDe differs from UST in a key way: UST was unbacked, instead holding its peg through automated arbitrage with another Terra-issued token. Nevertheless, some of USDe\u2019s critics said that it would inevitably lose its peg, or that its peg stability mechanism might fail during an industry-wide downturn. Others pointed to a pair of struggling projects that tried something very similar, the Solana-based UXD and the Ethereum-based Lemma. In short: it\u2019s no Terra, but it\u2019s riskier than, say, USDC, according to critics. Ethena Labs stopped marketing USDe as a stablecoin in October, after it received criticism from Columbia Business School professor Austin Campbell. \u201cWe have called it a synthetic dollar which we think captures the essence of the product,\u201d Young said on X Wednesday. In response to the criticism, Ethena has taken additional steps to distance itself from other stablecoins. It added a disclaimer to its website that users must accept before minting USDe. \u201cEthena\u2019s USDe is not the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, collateralized with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions. This means that the risks involved are inherently different,\u201d the project states on its site. Ethena also added a disclaimer to the beginning of USDe\u2019s technical documentation. While defending USDe\u2019s design, Young issued a sort of a mea culpa Thursday. \u201cAfter what we saw last cycle, we just need to be more diligent,\u201d he said on the forum, in an apparent reference to Terra. \u201cThis is both on the Ethena side, but then also as an industry, just think about how we\u2019re marketing products to users who might not sort of understand them as well as we do.\u201d He also invited critics of the company\u2019s branding to suggest alternatives. \u201c[I\u2019m] more than happy for you to sort of jump in and guide us with any sort of suggested changes,\u201d he said.

                "keypoints": "Nigeria\u2019s naira fell massively on Wednesday, and crypto trading is being blamed.\nCrypto detractors say the market is being used to manipulate the dollar exchange rate.\nNigeria\u2019s naira has lost 90% of its value against the dollar in the last eight months.",
                "body": " Binance and other crypto exchanges offering services to Nigerians are at the centre of a storm of controversy over currency speculation and forex market manipulation. That\u2019s because Nigeria\u2019s fiat currency, the naira, experienced massive volatility against the US dollar on Wednesday. First, the naira sunk to 1,900 against the dollar, an all-time low, followed by a sudden rise to 1,358 mere hours later. It was recently trading at 1,691 naira against the dollar \u2014 a 90% decline in only eight months. After clamping down on forex traders, Nigeria\u2019s government is targeting crypto trading platforms for their alleged role in currency manipulation, but Binance is distancing itself from any allegations. \u201cIt is important to note that foreign exchange rates are influenced by various complex factors, which Binance has no influence on,\u201d the exchange said in a blog post. The case against Binance reportedly lies in its market for trading USDT against NGN, a digital cash representation of the naira on the exchange. Binance introduced NGN in November 2022 as it allowed users to deposit cash from their local bank accounts to Binance. The NGN can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. NGN isn\u2019t the only digital cash on Binance as the exchange also has similar options for fiat currencies such as the Ghanaian cedi, Kuwaiti dinar, and Philippine peso. One official of Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency who spoke to DL News on the condition of anonymity said the agency is investigating a coordinated effort to manipulate the country\u2019s forex market via crypto trading on Binance. The purported market manipulation involves wash trading of the USDT\u2013NGN trading pair on the Binance spot market. Bad actors are allegedly creating fake buy and sell orders to crash the value of NGN against USDT on Binance, the official said. Binance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Volatility marked USDT-NGN trading on Binance on Wednesday (Binance) Those actions reportedly create a fake value for the US dollar in the Nigerian market as Binance peer-to-peer merchants also use the price feed from the spot market for their quotes. The alleged USDT exchange rate manipulation is reportedly spilling over into Nigeria\u2019s parallel forex market. Bureau de Change operators are reportedly using Binance quotes for the USDT\u2013NGN pair for their transactions with the public. That\u2019s even though Binance\u2019s spot trading volume for NGN against USDT, Tether\u2019s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, is a mere $3 million per day \u2014 several orders of magnitude lower than the $251 million in average daily turnover from the country\u2019s official forex market. As for other exchanges, their volumes are even smaller. \u201cIt\u2019s a data problem,\u201d said one Binance trader who wished to be known only as Bayo. \u201cThese Bureau De Change guys have never had real-time data for their market, and Binance offers an easy source for them to get real-time quotes.\u201d \u201cBinance is a victim of its own success,\u201d said another trader who declined to be named. \u201cCrypto\u2019s trading footprint in Nigeria might be small when you compare it with the official market and Bureau de Change agents, but it\u2019s electronic and very popular, especially among the youths.\u201d Last year, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reported that crypto trading in Nigeria grew 9% between 2021 and 2023. The firm ranked Nigeria second place in its global crypto adoption index. Binance also addressed claims of market manipulation earlier this week. The exchange said it noticed a \u201ctemporary suppression of prices\u201d that reached its system limit, which forced the platform to make adjustments to allow trading to continue. Speculation is rife within the country of a looming crypto ban. Unconfirmed reports say the government has ordered telecommunications companies that offer internet services to block access to crypto trading websites. Crypto trader Bayo warned the government could use the current situation as an excuse to prohibit crypto trading in Nigeria. Government officials contacted by DL News weren\u2019t immediately available for comments. Last year, the Association of Bureaux de Change Operators of Nigeria called for a ban on Binance. Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, the association\u2019s chairman, said Binance had unfortunately become the benchmark for forex trading in Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s government itself has historically cast a jaundiced glance at the crypto market. The country\u2019s central bank banned commercial banks from servicing crypto exchanges in 2021, but that order was reversed in December. A crypto ban would be the latest punitive action taken by Nigeria\u2019s government against perceived currency manipulators as the Naira continues to weaken. Nigeria\u2019s government has raided the offices of several Bureau de Change operators, including in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are on the rise. Stablecoin trading volume on centralised exchanges surged 4.5% to over $1 trillion in January \u2014 hitting its highest point since the tail end of the previous bull market, in December 2021, new research from CCData shows. \u201cVolumes are on track to record a higher total in February,\u201d CCData said, noting that $440 billion in stablecoins had traded on centralised exchanges as of February 16. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay on par with a government-issued currency like the US dollar. The total market value of stablecoins rose almost 2% in February, to $138 billion, CCData said. \u201cActing as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset sector, a rise in the supply of stablecoins is often followed by higher trading activity,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, told DL News. \u201cAn increase in stablecoin supply also indicates a higher demand for assets, which act as a key counterparty within the DeFi ecosystem,\u201d he added. However, stablecoin supply is often a lagging indicator, Clara Medalie, head of growth at research firm Kaiko, told DL News. \u201cMore stablecoins are issued in response to growing demand for their use in trading.\u201d The stablecoin market peaked at $187 billion in May 2022, according to DefiLlama data \u2014 just before Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin, UST, collapsed and wiped out tens of billions across the crypto ecosystem. Total stablecoin value then sunk as low as $128 billion in August, and began recovering in October. Despite the sector\u2019s growth, stablecoin dominance against the rest of the crypto market shrank from 8% to 7% in January \u2014 its lowest point since December 2021. The report attributed the loss of dominance to the rest of the crypto market trending upwards on the back of strong Bitcoin ETF inflows. .Not all stablecoins benefited equally from the rising tide. Tether\u2019s USDT, the largest stablecoin by value, rose by 1.2% to over $97 billion in circulating supply, but Circle\u2019s USDC outpaced it by surging 5.3% to $29 billion. USDT accounted for 75% of stablecoin trading activity on centralised exchanges this month, the report said \u2014 a decline from 79% in January and its lowest dominance versus other stablecoins since August. First Digital Limited\u2019s stablecoin, meanwhile, won market share from TrustToken\u2019s own coin. FDUSD went up more than 12%, to $2.4 billion, while TUSD fell 14% to $1.2 billion. CCData attributed this shift in popularity to FDUSD\u2019s zero-fee trading program on Binance. FDUSD now accounts for almost 16% of the stablecoin market on centralised exchanges. It has also overtaken Circle\u2019s stablecoin as the second most popular pair for Bitcoin, right behind Tether. The report also mentioned Ethena Labs\u2019 new USDe. Unlike the aforementioned stablecoins, USDe isn\u2019t backed one for one by dollar reserves, but by Ether and Ether derivatives. Investors can also lock up their USDe to create a token bearing an annual yield of 27%. While some investors have been able to mint USDe since December, the project opened up to retail users on February 16. Since then, USDe has risen to $360 million in value, according to CoinGecko data \u2014 already making it the 10th largest stablecoin. Tom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

                "keypoints": "Gauntlet has stopped working with Aave, citing inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of DAO stakeholders.\nThe move follows several disagreements between the risk management firm and Aave community members.",
                "body": " DeFi risk management firm Gauntlet has parted ways with lending protocol Aave over difficulties working with the DAO and its largest stakeholders. In a post on the Aave governance forum on Wednesday, Gauntlet COO and co-founder John Morrow said his firm will terminate its payment stream as soon as possible and will work with other Aave contributors to find a replacement for its role in the DAO. \u201cGauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave,\u201d Morrow said. Morrow highlighted several incidents where Gauntlet received criticism from Aave community members that led to the firm\u2019s decision to depart. At the beginning of February, Gauntlet was criticised for setting up a way to distribute ARB token emissions to Aave users, only to receive overwhelming support for a similar proposal to distribute OP tokens days later. \u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve found it difficult to navigate the inconsistent guidelines and unwritten objectives of the largest stakeholders,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cBecause of all of this, the best place to continue Gauntlet\u2019s mission is elsewhere.\u201d Gauntlet has served as Aave DAO\u2019s independent risk manager since 2020. In the role, the firm monitors risks to Aave\u2019s lending markets, such as liquidation risks, deployments on new blockchains, and accepting new assets as collateral, among other things. Aave is Ethereum\u2019s biggest lending protocol with over $8.3 billion in deposits. The protocol is governed through a decentralised autonomous organisation \u2014 or DAO \u2014 structure, meaning AAVE token holders propose and vote on changes to the protocol and its management. Aave DAO renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services in December at a cost of $1.6 million annually. Gauntlet had initially requested $2 million. In its four years serving as an independent risk manager to Aave DAO, Gauntlet has clashed with Aave stakeholders numerous times. In July, Gauntlet proposed that Aave DAO freeze Curve tokens and set the loan-to-value ratio for Curve on Aave v2 to zero to mitigate risks posed by Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov\u2019s $65 million loan position on the crypto lending protocol. In response, Aave stakeholders accused Gauntlet of pushing for a proposal that the DAO had already voted on and dismissed. At the time, Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller, who has been critical of Gauntlet on several occasions, said that the firm\u2019s \u201cattempt to sneak it back in another proposal has been noted and will be remembered.\u201d \u201cWe have no strong preference to push, or sneak, anything through,\u201d Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra told DL News at the time. \u201cIn our experience it\u2019s good to temp check the community when there is no reactive urgency perceived.\u201d Then in December, Gauntlet recommended that Aave DAO wait until its GHO stablecoin traded at its intended dollar peg before introducing the GHO Stability Module, a protocol that would let anyone who holds GHO redeem the token for USDT or USDC on a one-to-one basis. When put to a vote, Aave token holders voted to implement the GHO Stability Module immediately, despite Gauntlet\u2019s recommendation. Gauntlet is not the only DAO service provider to butt heads with the Aave community. In August, Aave DAO members voted in favour of reducing payments to its DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for Aave DAO and upgrades for the Aave lending protocol. Aave stakeholders said Llama had \u201cfallen short of expectations\u201d on several occasions. Llama, the onchain governance company, is unrelated to Llama Corp, which owns DL News. Correction: This article previously stated that Aave renewed Gauntlet\u2019s services for $2 million in December. This has been corrected to $1.6 million.

                "body": " Most people might find a few coins, and if they are lucky, a few dollars wedged between their couch cushions. But decentralised exchange Curve Finance now has around $290,000 in revenue hidden away. Some $124,000 in revenue from the wxDAI/USDC/USDT pool and $166,000 in revenue from over 160 other pools are stuck until the fees are manually claimed. This isn\u2019t the first time Curve found money in its proverbial couch cushions: Back in July 2023, the DAO claimed over $280,000 that was also stuck. Couch cushions are a name given by Curve users for liquidity pools that have uncollected fees in them. Once collected, the fees will be distributed to veCRV stakeholders. veCRV is obtained by staking and locking CRV for a period of up to four years. Curve is deployed across 13 chains and has hundreds of liquidity pools. On chains like Gnosis Chain, claiming these revenues is not as simple as claiming revenue on Ethereum, and as a result, it has not yet been automated. For pools on Ethereum, it can cost more gas to claim than the underlying amount of the revenue, which results in revenue accumulating until it is high enough to cover the cost of gas. Notably, anyone can execute the code to collect the revenue, although if the steps are done in the wrong order, it can result in the claimer paying higher gas fees. For the week of February 7-14, Curve Finance generated $315,000 in revenue for the DAO. If the revenue in the couch cushions were claimed for this period, it would make up nearly 50% of the weekly distribution. The Curve DAO generates revenue from trading volumes, and with the release of a stablecoin in May 2023, the Curve DAO now has a second revenue stream with crvUSD. When trading volumes on Ethereum were at their peak, Curve was bringing in millions of dollars per week. In fact, in June 2022 the Curve DAO made over $4.4 million in a single week. But as trading volumes subsided, so did the fees generated by Curve. For the week that started on July 5, 2023, Curve generated only $54,000 for the DAO. Since that low, fees have rebounded, thanks to an increase in trading activity and the growth of crvUSD. crvUSD has a supply of over $140 million with a total of $5 million in total fees collected for the DAO. There are six different assets users can deposit to borrow crvUSD against, paying a variable borrowing rate between 8.2% and 11.8%. With trading volumes beginning to pick up, alongside an increase in the crvUSD supply, the total fees generated by Curve are diversified and increasing. Curve has plans for another revenue stream, with a new lending product. Details about the lending product are scarce, but the official Curve Finance account stated on social media that users will be able to list any assets with permission. It is expected that revenue generated by this product will also be earmarked for the Curve DAO. A poll is being conducted in the CRV Social Channel where users can vote on the name for this product, with \u201clend.curve.fi\u201d in the lead over the only other option, llamalend.
