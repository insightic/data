According to a message from BlockBeats on March 12th, as shown on the community governance forum, Westwood proposed to reactivate the fee switch on the FRAX Finance forum. The proposal stated that the collateralization ratio (CR) of FRAX was 98.8%, close to 100%, and the overall market sentiment was bullish. Therefore, it was suggested to resume the distribution of fees to veFXS holders. Prior to the protocol obtaining external collateral, fees should be distributed to veFXS holders and the protocol treasury in a ratio of 75/25.",

The roadmap includes ambitious plans to achieve a Fraxtal TVL (Total Value Locked) of over $100 billion by the end of 2026. A significant part of this strategy involves launching 23 official L3s to initiate the Fraxtal Nation community. These L3 chains will not only be able to earn FXTL points through Flox but will also have reserved slots for official partners, who will receive additional support from Fraxtal core developers and large allocations of FXTL. Furthermore, Frax plans to introduce new assets such as FRXNEAR, FRXTIA, and FRXMETIS this year.

A significant part of this strategy involves launching 23 official L3s to initiate the Fraxtal Nation community.

Furthermore, Frax plans to introduce new assets such as FRXNEAR, FRXTIA, and FRXMETIS this year. Kazemian also proposed financial strategies including reopening the protocol fee switch, with 50% of proceeds going to VEFXS and the other 50% used for repurchasing FXS and other Frax assets. Additionally, a reduction in the conversion rate from FPIS to VEFXS by 67%, setting a new rate of 1 FPIS to 1.33 VEFXS with a four-year lock-up period, was proposed.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability.

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data.

EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability.

A significant number of projects are expected to debut following the release. Fraxtal aims to enhance Frax's product suite, which includes a fully collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, a lending platform, an automated market maker, an inflation-linked stablecoin (FPI), and the liquidity provider token FRXETH. The new blockchain will utilize rollup technology to execute transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, offering batch processing and data compression.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

The roadmap includes ambitious plans to achieve a Fraxtal TVL (Total Value Locked) of over $100 billion by the end of 2026. A significant part of this strategy involves launching 23 official L3s to initiate the Fraxtal Nation community. These L3 chains will not only be able to earn FXTL points through Flox but will also have reserved slots for official partners, who will receive additional support from Fraxtal core developers and large allocations of FXTL. Furthermore, Frax plans to introduce new assets such as FRXNEAR, FRXTIA, and FRXMETIS this year. Kazemian also proposed financial strategies including reopening the protocol fee switch, with 50% of proceeds going to VEFXS and the other 50% used for repurchasing FXS and other Frax assets. Additionally, a reduction in the conversion rate from FPIS to VEFXS by 67%, setting a new rate of 1 FPIS to 1.33 VEFXS with a four-year lock-up period, was proposed.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data.

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

Fraxtal aims to enhance Frax's product suite, which includes a fully collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, a lending platform, an automated market maker, an inflation-linked stablecoin (FPI), and the liquidity provider token FRXETH. The new blockchain will utilize rollup technology to execute transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, offering batch processing and data compression. FRXETH will serve as the power source for Layer 2 and will be used to pay gas fees on the blockchain.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

The roadmap includes ambitious plans to achieve a Fraxtal TVL (Total Value Locked) of over $100 billion by the end of 2026. A significant part of this strategy involves launching 23 official L3s to initiate the Fraxtal Nation community. These L3 chains will not only be able to earn FXTL points through Flox but will also have reserved slots for official partners, who will receive additional support from Fraxtal core developers and large allocations of FXTL. Furthermore, Frax plans to introduce new assets such as FRXNEAR, FRXTIA, and FRXMETIS this year. Kazemian also proposed financial strategies including reopening the protocol fee switch, with 50% of proceeds going to VEFXS and the other 50% used for repurchasing FXS and other Frax assets. Additionally, a reduction in the conversion rate from FPIS to VEFXS by 67%, setting a new rate of 1 FPIS to 1.33 VEFXS with a four-year lock-up period, was proposed.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

Fraxtal aims to enhance Frax's product suite, which includes a fully collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, a lending platform, an automated market maker, an inflation-linked stablecoin (FPI), and the liquidity provider token FRXETH. The new blockchain will utilize rollup technology to execute transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, offering batch processing and data compression. FRXETH will serve as the power source for Layer 2 and will be used to pay gas fees on the blockchain.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

Furthermore, Frax plans to introduce new assets such as FRXNEAR, FRXTIA, and FRXMETIS this year. Kazemian also proposed financial strategies including reopening the protocol fee switch, with 50% of proceeds going to VEFXS and the other 50% used for repurchasing FXS and other Frax assets. Additionally, a reduction in the conversion rate from FPIS to VEFXS by 67%, setting a new rate of 1 FPIS to 1.33 VEFXS with a four-year lock-up period, was proposed.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage.

EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

Within the Cosmos ecosystem, Noble is known for being the native asset issuance network for Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, from which it can move to other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Celestia, Sei, Injective, and Neutron. There is over $200 million of native USDC currently outstanding following its launch in September 2023.

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data.

It is anticipated that general users will soon gain access to the chain, which will serve as a platform for decentralized applications (DApps), focusing on decentralized finance. Frax, valued at over $1 billion, operates under the management of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. An airdrop snapshot for holders of the voted FXS tokens will be available on March 6, offering Fraxtal (FXTL) points, though it's unclear if these points will be replaced with a separate token in the future.",

As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",

EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale.

In the coming weeks, sFRXETH will be supported by EigenLayer AVS validators through a strategic partnership, offering holders points and additional earnings. The second snapshot date for FXTL points has been moved to April 18 at 07:59 to allow more community participation in staking veFXS on Fraxtal.",

This is in addition to its current issuance on Ethereum, where it has a total value locked of over $1.1 billion. FRAX\u2019s initial offerings on Noble will include the FRAX token, a decentralized stablecoin that combines collateralized and algorithmic mechanisms for peg stability, and sFRAX, a staked version of FRAX that aims to provide a yield. Within the Cosmos ecosystem, Noble is known for being the native asset issuance network for Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin, from which it can move to other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Celestia, Sei, Injective, and Neutron. There is over $200 million of native USDC currently outstanding following its launch in September 2023. This is not the first instance of an Ethereum-based project extending its reach into the Cosmos ecosystem. Previous integrations include Lido\u2019s staked ether (STETH) tokens and the DAI stablecoin. However, these were introduced to Cosmos as bridged versions, rather than native ones.",

                "body": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Frax Finance has recently passed a community governance proposal that greenlighted a $250 million allocation of EthEna Labs\u2019 USDE to a new liquidity pool. As part of Frax\u2019s Singularity Roadmap, the proposal enables the creation of an Automated Market Operation (AMO) that will allow the minting of new Frax tokens backed by overcollateralized debt. The proposal was approved on April 5. The proposal will create one of the deepest liquidity pools in the DeFi space, while enabling Frax to diversify its backing yield, according to EthEna Labs, which wrote in an April 8 X post: \u201cAs of yesterday, Frax has begun adding USDE POL which will create one of the deepest pools of dollar liquidity on-chain, and enable Frax to diversify their source of backing yield.\u201d The new Curve-based liquidity pool held $44.9 million worth of liquidity as of 10:45 AM UTC, with $30.6 million worth of Frax coins and $14.6 million worth of the USDE synthetic dollar, according to Curve Finance data. EthEna Labs surpassed the $2 billion mark in total value locked (TVL) on April 6, in less than two months since USDE was launched on the mainnet on Feb. 19, according to DeFiLlama data. The protocol is currently offering a 37.1% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDE to over 125,300 investors, according to its homepage. EthEna Labs made headlines last week after it announced adding Bitcoin backing to its USDE synthetic dollar in an effort to further scale from its current $2 billion supply. EthEna Labs became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8 when it offered a 67% APY on USDE, prompting widespread community concerns about the protocol\u2019s financial sustainability. Following its success, EthEna also caught the attention of large investment funds, becoming the highest-conviction bet for Delphi Ventures for the current cycle. USDE could become the largest dollar-backed asset after Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, according to Jos\u00e9 Maria Macedo, the CEO of Delphi Labs and the founding partner of crypto investment firm Delphi Ventures, who wrote in an April 2 post: \u201cSUSDE will offer the highest dollar yield in crypto at scale. USDE will become the largest stablecoin outside of USDC/USDT in 2024. EthEna will become the highest revenue-generating project in all of crypto.\u201d",
