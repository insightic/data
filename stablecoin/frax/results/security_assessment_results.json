It is a decentralized governance protocol that enables users to create, vote on, and execute proposals related to itself and the wider Frax Finance system.\" .\n\n- \"The Frax Finance governance system codebase is notably intricate for a governance system. Its dual pathways for proposals, voting delegation, and time-decaying voting power could introduce various unexpected interactions.\" .\n\n- \"FraxGovernorAlpha: This contract is a decentralized governance system designed to facilitate proposal creation, voting, and execution. It implements essential governance functionalities such as proposal management, voting, and proposal execution and cancellation, and it offers configurable settings that can be updated through the voting process.\" .\n\n- \"FraxGovernorAlpha extends the standard features to support fractional voting on proposals, enabling more nuanced decision-making.\" .\n\n- \"By inheriting from the GovernorTimelockControl contract, FraxGovernorAlpha introduces an essential time delay enforced by the TimelockController contract before successful proposals are executed.\" .\n\n- \"FraxGovernorAlpha features a high quorum threshold, ensuring a significant level of participation is required to reach consensus on proposals. As a module on the underlying Gnosis Safe, it holds full control over the associated Gnosis Safe, as well as all governance parameters on the FraxGovernorOmega contract and itself.\" .\n\n- \"FraxGovernorOmega: This contract is a decentralized governance system similar to FraxGovernorAlpha, acting as a signer for the underlying Gnosis Safe.\" .\n\n- \"FraxGovernorOmega empowers token holders to actively participate in shaping and governing the Frax Finance ecosystem, ensuring a robust and inclusive governance process.\" .\n\n- \"VeFxsVotingDelegation: This contract allows users to use veFXS tokens to delegate their voting rights to another address. It employs a checkpoint system to monitor and record changes in delegation and voting power over time, ensuring accurate and timely tracking.\" .\n\n\nYes\n\nTOB-FRAXGOV-5: The relay function can be used to call critical safe functions \nResolved in commit 00d0b07 . The relay function has been updated in the Governor \ncontract to revert whenever it is called. Furthermore, the propose function has been \nupdated to revert whenever it is called, so the attack vector for this issue has been \nremoved by both of these updates. \n\nTOB-FRAXGOV-6: Votes can be delegated to contracts \nNot resolved. Frax Finance provided the following statement about this issue: \nThis behavior is intended. \n\nTOB-FRAXGOV-7: Lack of public documentation regarding voting power expiry \nNot resolved. Frax Finance provided the following statement about this issue: \nThis will be addressed in documentation. \n\nTOB-FRAXGOV-8: Spamming risk in propose functions \nPartially resolved in commit ed4e708 . The propose function has been updated in the \nFraxGovernanceOmega contract to revert whenever it is called. However, in the \nFraxGovernanceAlpha contract it is still possible for a user to spam the propose function \nso long as the caller meets the proposal threshold. Frax Finance provided the following \nstatement about this issue: \nThis will be mitigated via minimum proposal voting power requirements configured \nduring deployment.\n",
