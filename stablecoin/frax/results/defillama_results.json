                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "DeFi investors punt nearly $1m into new Ethereum hybrid staking protocol offering 10% yield",
                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. PayPool. Probably nothing https://t.co/omiM2PThDa pic.twitter.com/oJlzrzkQVg Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Cosmos. Ethereum. EigenLayer. pic.twitter.com/OJ1fgKtbAm Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack.

But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad.

Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities.

Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too.

Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "DeFi investors punt nearly $1m into new Ethereum hybrid staking protocol offering 10% yield",
                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 200,000,000 #USDT (201,241,000 USD) transferred from #JustLendDAO to unknown wallethttps://t.co/wWEDR2vdbN A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

PROPOSAL: Frax floats similar staking yields to MakerDAO\u2019s DSR The Frax core team wants to introduce sFRAX, a staked version of the protocol\u2019s stablecoin that earns interest. The proposal says sFRAX will target (but not guarantee) the same returns as the Federal Reserve Interest on Reserve Deposit Rate. A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week. Although the bodies have been widely discredited as a hoax (a report debunking them claimed they\u2019re fakes made from, among other things, llama bones), the humour of the situation didn\u2019t escape the crypto community. Dozen of accounts on Crypto Twitter used pictures of the aliens to do what they do best: create memes. Arbitrum\u2019s DAO has voted to allocate 50 million ARB tokens \u2014 currently worth about $41.5 million \u2014 to projects building on the layer 2 chain.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad.

Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week.

Dozen of accounts on Crypto Twitter used pictures of the aliens to do what they do best: create memes. Arbitrum\u2019s DAO has voted to allocate 50 million ARB tokens \u2014 currently worth about $41.5 million \u2014 to projects building on the layer 2 chain.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.
