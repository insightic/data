                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "DeFi investors punt nearly $1m into new Ethereum hybrid staking protocol offering 10% yield",
                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. PayPool. Probably nothing https://t.co/omiM2PThDa pic.twitter.com/oJlzrzkQVg Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Cosmos. Ethereum. EigenLayer. pic.twitter.com/OJ1fgKtbAm Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack.

But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad.

Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities.

Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too.

Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "DeFi investors punt nearly $1m into new Ethereum hybrid staking protocol offering 10% yield",
                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 200,000,000 #USDT (201,241,000 USD) transferred from #JustLendDAO to unknown wallethttps://t.co/wWEDR2vdbN A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

PROPOSAL: Frax floats similar staking yields to MakerDAO\u2019s DSR The Frax core team wants to introduce sFRAX, a staked version of the protocol\u2019s stablecoin that earns interest. The proposal says sFRAX will target (but not guarantee) the same returns as the Federal Reserve Interest on Reserve Deposit Rate. A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week. Although the bodies have been widely discredited as a hoax (a report debunking them claimed they\u2019re fakes made from, among other things, llama bones), the humour of the situation didn\u2019t escape the crypto community. Dozen of accounts on Crypto Twitter used pictures of the aliens to do what they do best: create memes. Arbitrum\u2019s DAO has voted to allocate 50 million ARB tokens \u2014 currently worth about $41.5 million \u2014 to projects building on the layer 2 chain.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad.

Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week.

Dozen of accounts on Crypto Twitter used pictures of the aliens to do what they do best: create memes. Arbitrum\u2019s DAO has voted to allocate 50 million ARB tokens \u2014 currently worth about $41.5 million \u2014 to projects building on the layer 2 chain.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice.

His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack.

But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks.

Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week. Although the bodies have been widely discredited as a hoax (a report debunking them claimed they\u2019re fakes made from, among other things, llama bones), the humour of the situation didn\u2019t escape the crypto community.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Curve Finance has placed a $1.9 million bounty on one of the exploiters who attacked the protocol on July 30.\nThe protocol placed the bounty after the hacker failed to return stolen funds by a Sunday deadline.\nSeparate hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH Curve trading pools retuned funds before the deadline.",
                "body": " Curve called on the public to identify one of the culprits behind last week\u2019s exploit after the hacker failed to return stolen funds by a Sunday deadline. The DeFi protocol put out an ultimatum to hackers on August 3: return all stolen funds (sans a 10% whitehat bounty) by 8am London time on August 6, or the protocol would put out a nearly $1.9 million bounty, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d \u201cIf the exploiter chooses to return the funds in full, we will not pursue this further,\u201d the message, sent out via an on-chain message, read. Hackers who separately exploited the Alchemix alETH-ETH and JPEG\u2019d pETH-ETH pools returned funds earlier this week. However, the hacker who drained the CRV-ETH pool for 32 million CRV tokens, worth around $18 million at the time of the hack, did not. The hope is that now the public bounty against the CRV-ETH pool exploiter is active, crypto sleuths, or entities with knowledge of the hacker\u2019s identity, will be motivated to come forward with information. Several of Curve\u2019s liquidity pools were drained by hackers on July 30. After an initial exploit to the pETH-ETH pool, word of the vulnerability spread, leading to several seemingly unconnected hackers exploiting various Curve trading pools in the hours that followed. In total, hackers drained over $61 million worth of crypto from Curve. Shortly after the exploits, developers determined that the attacks were possible due to a vulnerability in Vyper, the programming language used to develop Curve\u2019s liquidity pools. NOW READ: How hackers turn stolen crypto into cash Vyper developers published a postmortem of the exploits on August 6, identifying several older versions of the programming language that are also vulnerable. They also proposed new measures to prevent similar exploits in the future. Curve\u2019s ultimatum asking the exploiters to return funds in exchange for 10% of the stolen funds and the promise that they will not pursue legal action was mostly effective, despite the CRV-ETH pool hacker\u2019s holdout. On August 4, JPEG\u2019d reported that the hacker who exploited the pETH-ETH pool returned 5,494 wrapped Ether, worth approximately $10 million, fulfilling the conditions of the ultimatum. Then a day later on August 5, Alchemix tweeted that the hacker who had exploited the alETH-ETH pool also returned $22 million worth of stolen funds. NOW READ: Indexed Finance hacker now says he\u2019s a whitehat Rather than walking away with the 10% bounty, the Alchemix exploiter proceeded to taunt both Alchemix, and crypto sleuths attempting to uncover their identity. \u201cI saw some ridiculous views,\u201d they wrote in an on-chain message, \u201cso [I] want to clarify that I\u2019m refunding you not because you can find me, but because I don\u2019t want to ruin your project, maybe it\u2019s a lot of money for a lot of people but not for me, I\u2019m smarter than all of you.\u201d However, their attitude was short-lived. In another message on August 5, the exploiter wrote, \u201cHistory is written by the victors, I make huge mistake, so you are smarter than me, great job!\u201d The return of funds stolen from the JPEG\u2019d and Alchemix pools comes as a relief to the protocols, and the users who lost money. But it has done little to assuage the fears of DeFi lending protocols tied up in loans to Curve founder Michael Egorov. Egorov\u2019s biggest loan used $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply \u2014 to borrow $65 million from lending protocol Aave. Egorov also has smaller CRV-backed loans at Fraxlend, Abracadabra, and Inverse Finance. These loans have become risky because CRV liquidity has declined. This shrinking liquidity was exacerbated by the $18 million worth of CRV stolen from the CRV-ETH pool. With thin CRV liquidity across DeFi, if the CRV-ETH pool exploiter attempts to sell their stolen CRV, it would likely crash the token\u2019s price and could force Egorov\u2019s loans into liquidation. If the loans are liquidated in one protocol, it could spread panic and lead to a cascade of liquidations at the others \u2014 potentially leaving one of them holding the bulk of the bad debt and being forced to use its own funds to pay it off. Egorov recently sold $46 million worth of CRV in over-the-counter deals to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and digital asset market maker DWF Labs. DL News previously asked Egorov if the deals had helped him stabilise his loans for the foreseeable future. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that all the July 30 Curve Finance exploits were conducted by a single entity. It has been corrected to make clear that separate entities exploited the alETH-ETH, pETH-ETH, and CRV-ETH trading pools respectively.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Read more about Sushiswap\u2019s vampire attack on incumbent decentralised exchange Uniswap.\nExplore the reasons Bitcoin\u2019s many forked networks came into being.",
                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Curve Finance has placed a $1.9 million bounty on one of the exploiters who attacked the protocol on July 30.\nThe protocol placed the bounty after the hacker failed to return stolen funds by a Sunday deadline.\nSeparate hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH Curve trading pools retuned funds before the deadline.",
                "body": " Curve called on the public to identify one of the culprits behind last week\u2019s exploit after the hacker failed to return stolen funds by a Sunday deadline. The DeFi protocol put out an ultimatum to hackers on August 3: return all stolen funds (sans a 10% whitehat bounty) by 8am London time on August 6, or the protocol would put out a nearly $1.9 million bounty, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d \u201cIf the exploiter chooses to return the funds in full, we will not pursue this further,\u201d the message, sent out via an on-chain message, read. Hackers who separately exploited the Alchemix alETH-ETH and JPEG\u2019d pETH-ETH pools returned funds earlier this week. However, the hacker who drained the CRV-ETH pool for 32 million CRV tokens, worth around $18 million at the time of the hack, did not. The hope is that now the public bounty against the CRV-ETH pool exploiter is active, crypto sleuths, or entities with knowledge of the hacker\u2019s identity, will be motivated to come forward with information. Several of Curve\u2019s liquidity pools were drained by hackers on July 30. After an initial exploit to the pETH-ETH pool, word of the vulnerability spread, leading to several seemingly unconnected hackers exploiting various Curve trading pools in the hours that followed. In total, hackers drained over $61 million worth of crypto from Curve. Shortly after the exploits, developers determined that the attacks were possible due to a vulnerability in Vyper, the programming language used to develop Curve\u2019s liquidity pools. NOW READ: How hackers turn stolen crypto into cash Vyper developers published a postmortem of the exploits on August 6, identifying several older versions of the programming language that are also vulnerable. They also proposed new measures to prevent similar exploits in the future. Curve\u2019s ultimatum asking the exploiters to return funds in exchange for 10% of the stolen funds and the promise that they will not pursue legal action was mostly effective, despite the CRV-ETH pool hacker\u2019s holdout. On August 4, JPEG\u2019d reported that the hacker who exploited the pETH-ETH pool returned 5,494 wrapped Ether, worth approximately $10 million, fulfilling the conditions of the ultimatum. Then a day later on August 5, Alchemix tweeted that the hacker who had exploited the alETH-ETH pool also returned $22 million worth of stolen funds. NOW READ: Indexed Finance hacker now says he\u2019s a whitehat Rather than walking away with the 10% bounty, the Alchemix exploiter proceeded to taunt both Alchemix, and crypto sleuths attempting to uncover their identity. \u201cI saw some ridiculous views,\u201d they wrote in an on-chain message, \u201cso [I] want to clarify that I\u2019m refunding you not because you can find me, but because I don\u2019t want to ruin your project, maybe it\u2019s a lot of money for a lot of people but not for me, I\u2019m smarter than all of you.\u201d However, their attitude was short-lived. In another message on August 5, the exploiter wrote, \u201cHistory is written by the victors, I make huge mistake, so you are smarter than me, great job!\u201d The return of funds stolen from the JPEG\u2019d and Alchemix pools comes as a relief to the protocols, and the users who lost money. But it has done little to assuage the fears of DeFi lending protocols tied up in loans to Curve founder Michael Egorov. Egorov\u2019s biggest loan used $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply \u2014 to borrow $65 million from lending protocol Aave. Egorov also has smaller CRV-backed loans at Fraxlend, Abracadabra, and Inverse Finance. These loans have become risky because CRV liquidity has declined. This shrinking liquidity was exacerbated by the $18 million worth of CRV stolen from the CRV-ETH pool. With thin CRV liquidity across DeFi, if the CRV-ETH pool exploiter attempts to sell their stolen CRV, it would likely crash the token\u2019s price and could force Egorov\u2019s loans into liquidation. If the loans are liquidated in one protocol, it could spread panic and lead to a cascade of liquidations at the others \u2014 potentially leaving one of them holding the bulk of the bad debt and being forced to use its own funds to pay it off. Egorov recently sold $46 million worth of CRV in over-the-counter deals to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and digital asset market maker DWF Labs. DL News previously asked Egorov if the deals had helped him stabilise his loans for the foreseeable future. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that all the July 30 Curve Finance exploits were conducted by a single entity. It has been corrected to make clear that separate entities exploited the alETH-ETH, pETH-ETH, and CRV-ETH trading pools respectively.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here, and welcome back to The Decentralised, getting you up to speed on the biggest DeFi news of the past seven days. There\u2019s really only been one big story this week \u2014 the aftermath of last weekend\u2019s Curve Finance exploits that saw hackers swipe $61 million from multiple trading pools. First off, the good news: hackers who exploited the alETH and pETH pools have returned a combined $32 million in stolen funds after Curve put out an ultimatum on August 3. The protocol agreed not to pursue legal action against the hackers if they returned 90% of the stolen funds before August 6. However, the CRV-ETH pool exploiter, who currently holds around $18 million worth of CRV tokens, did not return the funds by the deadline. In response, Curve has put out a $1.85 million bounty on the hacker, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the situation to see if any crypto sleuths can identify the hacker holdout. Early last week, Aleks Gilbert reported on criticism received by crypto security firm BlockSec following the Curve exploits. BlockSec tweeted out details about the exploits as they were still ongoing. The firm says it was warning users to help them withdraw money before another hacker could strike, while critics argue BlockSec\u2019s tweet drew unnecessary attention to the hack. Check out the full story, and find out what Curve founder Michael Egorov thought of the whole debacle, here. The situation with the CRV-ETH pool hacker is concerning not just because of the millions of dollars worth of crypto stolen. Following the exploit, the hacker now holds a huge chunk of CRV, and any attempt to sell the tokens could crash their price and threaten to liquidate Egorov\u2019s DeFi loans. Egorov didn\u2019t wait to see whether or not the hacker was going to return the stolen CRV before taking action, though. On August 1, he began selling off chunks of CRV in over-the-counter deals to anyone willing to take them. So far, he\u2019s sold $46 million worth to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and several DeFi whales. He then used the proceeds to pay off parts of his loans and lower their liquidation threshold. On July 31, Egorov\u2019s Aave loan was at risk of liquidation if CRV dropped below $0.36 per token. Now that figure\u2019s dropped to $0.28 after he provided additional collateral. However, with Egorov\u2019s loans continuing to accrue interest, he\u2019ll need to find a more permanent solution to his financial situation before he \u2014 and those entangled in his loans \u2014 can rest easy. And Egorov\u2019s loans aren\u2019t the only thing weighing on the minds of Aave DAO members, the collective of token holders who govern the lending protocol. As Osato Avan-Nomayo reported, a dispute currently rages between Aave DAO delegate Marc Zeller and DeFi management company Llama, which provides treasury management for the DAO. Zeller\u2019s proposal seeks to cancel Aave DAO\u2019s contract with Llama, accusing the company of overcharging for its services and underdelivering on targets. Llama rejected Zeller\u2019s characterisation of its work and said he \u201cmisrepresents facts.\u201d Read the full story here to get all the intricate details and learn about how Aave token holders are voting on Zeller\u2019s proposal. Aave v2 breaks weekly revenue record (@DefiLlama) Amid the situation with Egorov\u2019s precarious CRV-backed loan and all the Zeller-Llama drama, Aave v2 recorded its highest weekly revenue ever at $2.66 million. The spike was likely caused by programmatic increases in loan interest as users withdrew money to avoid bad debt from a possible Egorov liquidation. TEMP CHECK: Should Aave raise the slashing percentage on staked AAVE tokens? AAVE holders can earn over 6% staking their tokens in the protocol\u2019s safety module. The risk? Stakers stand to lose 30% if the protocol encounters a shortfall event such as accruing bad debt. Xenophon Labs thinks this deal favours AAVE stakers a bit too much, and wants to increase the slashing percentage to 60%, and then potentially 100% to make things safer for the lending protocol. PROPOSAL: Lido to cover expenses by selling stETH for DAI Steakhouse Financial, Lido\u2019s financial workstream provider, wants to convert stETH to DAI at regular intervals to to secure enough stablecoin working capital to pay contributors. PROPOSAL: Frax to onboard FinresPBC to hold real-world assets Frax needs a way to hold cash and other cash-equivalent assets for its v3 real-world asset strategies. To accomplish this CEO Sam Kazemian has helped set up FinresPBC, a public benefit corporation, to hold these assets on Frax\u2019s behalf. Euler CEO Michael Bentley captures the current mood toward lending protocols using the classic \u201cChad vs Virgin\u201d meme. Egorov\u2019s CRV-backed loan has exposed the difficulty lenders face trying to balance incentives and stay safe in the DeFi wild west. On the other hand, automated market makers \u2014 for example, Uniswap \u2014 appear impervious by comparison, and don\u2019t need to worry about the finer details which have wrought chaos at lending protocols. A wallet, which some believe belongs to Tron founder Justin Sun, has withdrawn $200 million USDT from Tron-based lending protocol JustLend and deposited it to centralised exchange Huobi. This comes after reports of arrested Huobi executives and rumors that the exchange is insolvent circulated earlier this week. A Huobi spokesperson told journalists at CoinDesk that such rumors are false, and that the $200 million it received wasn\u2019t from Sun. Still, users withdrew over $600 million from the exchange over the past month. Do you have a tip-off, a question or an opinion about DeFi? Email me: tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " Curve called on the public to identify one of the culprits behind last week\u2019s exploit after the hacker failed to return stolen funds by a Sunday deadline. The DeFi protocol put out an ultimatum to hackers on August 3: return all stolen funds (sans a 10% whitehat bounty) by 8am London time on August 6, or the protocol would put out a nearly $1.9 million bounty, claimable by anyone who \u201cis able to identify the exploiter in a way that leads to a conviction in the courts.\u201d \u201cIf the exploiter chooses to return the funds in full, we will not pursue this further,\u201d the message, sent out via an on-chain message, read. Hackers who separately exploited the Alchemix alETH-ETH and JPEG\u2019d pETH-ETH pools returned funds earlier this week. However, the hacker who drained the CRV-ETH pool for 32 million CRV tokens, worth around $18 million at the time of the hack, did not. The hope is that now the public bounty against the CRV-ETH pool exploiter is active, crypto sleuths, or entities with knowledge of the hacker\u2019s identity, will be motivated to come forward with information. Several of Curve\u2019s liquidity pools were drained by hackers on July 30. After an initial exploit to the pETH-ETH pool, word of the vulnerability spread, leading to several seemingly unconnected hackers exploiting various Curve trading pools in the hours that followed. In total, hackers drained over $61 million worth of crypto from Curve. Shortly after the exploits, developers determined that the attacks were possible due to a vulnerability in Vyper, the programming language used to develop Curve\u2019s liquidity pools. NOW READ: How hackers turn stolen crypto into cash Vyper developers published a postmortem of the exploits on August 6, identifying several older versions of the programming language that are also vulnerable. They also proposed new measures to prevent similar exploits in the future. Curve\u2019s ultimatum asking the exploiters to return funds in exchange for 10% of the stolen funds and the promise that they will not pursue legal action was mostly effective, despite the CRV-ETH pool hacker\u2019s holdout. On August 4, JPEG\u2019d reported that the hacker who exploited the pETH-ETH pool returned 5,494 wrapped Ether, worth approximately $10 million, fulfilling the conditions of the ultimatum. Then a day later on August 5, Alchemix tweeted that the hacker who had exploited the alETH-ETH pool also returned $22 million worth of stolen funds. NOW READ: Indexed Finance hacker now says he\u2019s a whitehat Rather than walking away with the 10% bounty, the Alchemix exploiter proceeded to taunt both Alchemix, and crypto sleuths attempting to uncover their identity. \u201cI saw some ridiculous views,\u201d they wrote in an on-chain message, \u201cso [I] want to clarify that I\u2019m refunding you not because you can find me, but because I don\u2019t want to ruin your project, maybe it\u2019s a lot of money for a lot of people but not for me, I\u2019m smarter than all of you.\u201d However, their attitude was short-lived. In another message on August 5, the exploiter wrote, \u201cHistory is written by the victors, I make huge mistake, so you are smarter than me, great job!\u201d The return of funds stolen from the JPEG\u2019d and Alchemix pools comes as a relief to the protocols, and the users who lost money. But it has done little to assuage the fears of DeFi lending protocols tied up in loans to Curve founder Michael Egorov. Egorov\u2019s biggest loan used $220 million worth of Curve tokens \u2014 which represents 30% of the entire Curve supply \u2014 to borrow $65 million from lending protocol Aave. Egorov also has smaller CRV-backed loans at Fraxlend, Abracadabra, and Inverse Finance. These loans have become risky because CRV liquidity has declined. This shrinking liquidity was exacerbated by the $18 million worth of CRV stolen from the CRV-ETH pool. With thin CRV liquidity across DeFi, if the CRV-ETH pool exploiter attempts to sell their stolen CRV, it would likely crash the token\u2019s price and could force Egorov\u2019s loans into liquidation. If the loans are liquidated in one protocol, it could spread panic and lead to a cascade of liquidations at the others \u2014 potentially leaving one of them holding the bulk of the bad debt and being forced to use its own funds to pay it off. Egorov recently sold $46 million worth of CRV in over-the-counter deals to various parties including Tron founder Justin Sun, liquidity provider Wintermute, and digital asset market maker DWF Labs. DL News previously asked Egorov if the deals had helped him stabilise his loans for the foreseeable future. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that all the July 30 Curve Finance exploits were conducted by a single entity. It has been corrected to make clear that separate entities exploited the alETH-ETH, pETH-ETH, and CRV-ETH trading pools respectively.

                "body": " DeFi faces a new type of Curve wars. The term refers to the ongoing competition between DeFi protocols to snatch up shares of the enormous liquidity in the Curve Finance ecosystem. Here\u2019s what\u2019s changed: Rather than protocols vying among themselves to acquire more of Curve\u2019s CRV tokens, they now struggle to limit their exposure to loans collateralised by them. This development is due to renewed fears about the risks associated with an $80 million loan taken out by Curve founder Michael Egorov. Four DeFi lenders \u2014 Aave, Fraxlend, Abracadabra, and Inverse Finance \u2014 are exposed to Egorov\u2019s Curve-backed loans. Aave, DeFi\u2019s biggest lending protocol, has the greatest exposure among the lot, with Egorov holding a $50 million debt position on Aave v2. The remainder, roughly $30 million, is spread almost equally among the other three protocols. The loan has become particularly risky because Egorov used CRV as collateral and the token\u2019s liquidity has continued to decline. This shrinking liquidity was further exacerbated by a $40 million hack that drained several Curve pools at the end of July. The hack made Egorov\u2019s loan risky as the price of CRV fell dangerously close to levels that could have liquidated the debt position across those protocols. If the loan is liquidated in one protocol, it could spread panic and lead to a cascade of forced liquidations among the others \u2014 potentially leaving one of them holding the bulk of the bad debt and being forced to use its own funds to pay it off. NOW READ: Curve founder joins critics in slamming security firm\u2019s \u2018very bad\u2019 decision to live-tweet exploit Egorov has consistently serviced his loan on Fraxlend as the protocol\u2019s mitigation rules twisted his arm to do so, or risk skyrocketing interest rates. The others do not have such mitigation protocols and are rushing to remedy the situation. As such, they are now voting or considering governance proposals to ensure Egorov is incentivised to keep servicing his loans on their protocols. Egorov used his considerable stash of Curve tokens, almost 30% of its available supply, as collateral backing for the loan. The Curve collateral is currently worth $200 million, but the token\u2019s shrinking liquidity makes it susceptible to volatile price movements. The shrinking CRV liquidity incentivises short-selling of CRV to drive down the price and liquidate Egorov\u2019s position in the process. Avraham Eisenberg, who exploited DeFi protocol Mango Markets for $114 million last year, tried to hunt Egorov\u2019s position by shorting CRV in November 2022. NOW READ: Coinbase\u2019s Brian Armstrong and Curve liquidity issues dominated the news this week The attempt failed and Eisenberg suffered a $10 million loss but Aave was left with $1.6 million in bad debt. As such, these protocols know that adverse market conditions can put pressure on the loan position. They can be left with significant bad debt if Egorov is unable to pay off or sufficiently service his debts during such periods. The Aave and Abracadabra community are voting on risk mitigation proposals connected to the Curve loan. Inverse Finance is in the forum discussion stage of its governance process. NOW READ: \u2018No preference to sneak anything through\u2019: Gauntlet takes another shot at Curve founder\u2019s $64m loan on Aave Some Aave DAO members have previously clamoured for the DAO to reduce the risk associated with the debt position. DeFi risk manager Gauntlet has served multiple proposals to Aave DAO to deal with the debt position, but was voted down each time. DAO delegates like Mark Zeller, who have been against Gauntlet\u2019s proposal, noted that the suggested mitigation efforts were short of the mark. Zeller has said the recommendations ranged from harmful to the DAO to not having any remediating impact on the situation. NOW READ: \u2018I just want to help\u2019: Justin Sun scoops $2.9m worth of Curve founder\u2019s governance tokens amid liquidation crisis However, it appears the tide has turned within Aave DAO \u2014 the community is moving to adopt these previous recommendations. The current emergency vote, which began on August 1, has unanimous support among participants. The vote, once passed, will freeze Curve tokens on Aave v2. It will also set the loan-to-value ratio of Curve-backed loans to zero. Like Aave, Abracadabra\u2019s governance process for the issue has not been smooth. Abracadabra DAO previously considered a proposal to hike up the interest rate to 200% on the protocol\u2019s Curve cauldron. Abracadabra employs so-called isolated lending markets with specific collateral accepted in each cauldron. This differs from protocols where all the collateral is in a single pool. Such an arrangement is supposed to isolate risk for the protocol if a bad debt situation occurs in any of the silos. But there are fears that Egorov\u2019s loan could pose systemic risk to the stability of Abracadabra\u2019s stablecoin market. \u201cDespite having isolated lending markets, collateral\u2019s liquidity and price movements are important for MIM stability,\u201d a DAO contributor told DL News. MIM is a US dollar stablecoin issued by Abracadabra. Users deposit crypto assets as collateral to mint MIM with Abracadabra charging interest on their deposits. Negative reactions trailed the proposal and one community member voted with 10 billion SPELL \u2014 Abracadabra\u2019s governance token \u2014 to defeat the proposal. The DAO now has a second proposal with more modest interest rate parameters, which is expected to pass, especially as the same whale has voted with their 10 billion SPELL in favour of the proposal. Despite these steps, there is currently a sense of calm about the issue after the recent chaos. Egorov\u2019s average liquidation threshold is at a Curve price of $0.30, so the position is currently healthy as CRV is trading almost double that price. Egorov has also struck token sale deals with several notable crypto personalities to secure much-needed collateral to service these loans. The Curve founder has raised $42 million from these token sales as of August 4. \u201cAs long as Egorov repays and manages the position \u2014 thanks also to the incentives created by the interest rates spikes \u2014 the situation will progressively improve,\u201d an Abracadabra DAO contributor said.

                "body": " The DeFi stablecoin war is heating up. DeFi lending giant Aave looks set to challenge fellow DeFi heavyweights MakerDAO and Curve with the launch of its own US dollar stablecoin GHO, following the conclusion of a DAO vote. The vote, which ended on July 14, passed with near unanimous support from Aave DAO delegates, with 881,059 AAVE tokens used by supporters to back the proposal in contrast to 10 AAVE tokens against it. \u201cFollowing the approval of this [Aave Improvement Proposal] users of Aave V3 on Ethereum will be able to mint GHO against their collateral, kickstarting a new era for the Aave ecosystem and the Aave DAO,\u201d the proposal stated. GHO\u2019s launch on the Ethereum blockchain could happen as early as July 15 once the decision reached by the DAO is executed on-chain. GHO is an overcollateralised stablecoin \u2014 users submit crypto collateral in excess of the amount of the stablecoin they wish to mint. This excess collateral is determined by a collateral factor as prescribed by the protocol, designed to ensure the stablecoin keeps its peg amidst market fluctuations of the other assets it\u2019s hitched to. Once GHO is launched, it will join a group of DeFi-native stablecoins that has long been dominated by MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Stablecoins are a staple of DeFi protocols, regardless of their size. They form base trading pairs on these protocols and can be used for lending and borrowing to generate yield for both users and the protocols themselves. Despite the ubiquity of protocol-native stablecoins, many of the largest DeFi players like Aave have previously not floated their own stable cryptocurrencies. MakerDAO and Frax Finance were the prominent outliers in this trend. NOW READ: DeFi\u2019s biggest exchange Curve Finance takes a shot at stablecoins Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked of $5.9 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Total value locked is a DeFi metric that tracks the value of tokens locked into a protocol by users. Curve Finance, for its own part, is the largest stablecoin exchange and is a major hub for stablecoin liquidity. Curve recently launched its US dollar stablecoin called crvUSD and Aave is now set to follow suit. This could set the stage for an expanded DeFi stablecoin war among DAI, crvUSD, and GHO with Frax Finance\u2019s FRAX stablecoin not far behind. Yield generation could be at the centre of this tussle with each protocol devising means to incentivise interest in their respective stablecoins. The growing Ethereum liquid staking derivatives, or LSD token, market is likely to be a major component of these yield strategies. Major Ether LSDs, like Lido\u2019s stETH and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, are already popular collateral for loans on DeFi lending protocols. The market size of these DeFi stablecoins put together still pales in comparison to Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin which currently dominates the market. USDT currently accounts for almost two-thirds of the $127 billion stablecoin market, according to DefiLlama data. It is, however, not a DeFi-native stablecoin as it is issued by a centralised entity. DeFi proponents have often pushed for a broader adoption of protocol-native stablecoins instead of USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC \u2014 the two major players. They point to how centralised stablecoin issuers can block transactions as part of the reasons why they prefer decentralised alternatives.

The agency \u2014 a non-profit called Bluechip \u2014 wants to offer a reliable resource for crypto investors to understand the relative safety of the different pegged assets that power much of the crypto industry. Bluechip works similarly to Wall Street rating agencies such as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, which provide ratings for various investment products.

Bluechip's stablecoin ratings (Bluechip) On the other end of the spectrum, Bluechip gave USDD, a stablecoin with connections to the Tron blockchain and its founder Justin Sun, a failing F grade. Explaining the grade, Bluechip said it believes that \u201cUSDD\u2019s reserves are commingled with assets of Huobi,\u201d and strongly recommend users not to use it. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of our rating system is that we favour transparency. And if claims are opaque, we\u2019re erring on the side of caution and distrust,\u201d Garett Jones, Bluechip\u2019s chief economist, told DL News in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really the audit that\u2019s the most important single factor holding back Tether.\u201d Tether, currently the biggest stablecoin by market cap and deployed across 14 different blockchains, as well as TrueUSD and Frax, all received a D grade, indicating that they are \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to Tether, what ends up holding the rating down to a fairly low level is the lack of an audit \u2014 the fact that people can\u2019t be credibly convinced of its reserve plans,\u201d Jones said.

Although Tether has since started releasing quarterly attestations, it has failed to conduct a comprehensive third-party audit of its reserves. But it\u2019s not just audits that can make or break a stablecoin\u2019s rating. Bluechip looks at numerous factors, including how well a stablecoin has historically held its peg, how transparent its governance is, and the quality of its management, among other things. \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking at whether there are deep liquidity pools for each coin, although those are important traits,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking behind that to questions of governance.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just some sort of gut feeling about whether you like the team or not.\u201d That approach stems from Jones\u2019 background.

He also helped bring together an advisory group of other economists, including Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Alex Tabarrok and Lawrence H. White, to work on Bluechip. Other advisers include Nic Carter, general partner at VC firm Castle Island Ventures, and Ameen Soleimani, co-founder of Reflexer Labs that develops stablecoin Rai. Jones is one of the three team members behind the agency \u2014 the others are Austria-based CEO Benjamin Levit, and India-based ratings director Vaidya Pallasena, an accountant by training. Bluechip has received donations from Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO behind stablecoin Dai; stablecoin issuance platform Reserve\u2019s co-founder Nevin Freeman; Ethereum scaling solution Starkware\u2019s co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson; InnovaticGroup and others.

The company\u2019s \u201clargest investment\u201d to date will see Reserve buy Curve, Convex Finance and StakeDAO\u2019s governance tokens, Thomas Mattimore, head of protocol at Reserve, told DL News. \u201cOur investment is to help advance our stake in the Curve war game,\u201d Mattimore said. \u201cYield farmers are some of the most active users in DeFi, and Curve is one of the ways to connect with them most easily.\u201d California-headquartered Reserve is the company behind the Reserve Protocol, which allows users to mint asset-backed stablecoins called RTokens that are pegged to the US dollar. Reserve claimed its eUSD RToken has grossed $5.7 billion in transaction volume in Latin America via the protocol\u2019s RPay app since its 2020 launch. Other RTokens include dollar-pegged stablecoin High Yield USD and ETHPlus, an Ether staking index.

Coinbase Ventures and crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group have also injected capital into the firm. NOW READ: DeFi\u2019s biggest exchange Curve Finance takes a shot at stablecoins However, just like other stablecoin issuers, Reserve must ensure the liquidity of its assets. \u201cWithout liquidity, the RToken financial system would be much less efficient, grow slower and would be more prone to shocks,\u201d Mattimore said. That is where this latest investment comes in. By holding more governance tokens, Reserve aims to improve RTokens\u2019 liquidity. Ensuring liquidity is a major concern for stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers like Reserve attract liquidity by offering optimised yield to liquidity providers on major decentralised exchanges like Curve and Balancer. They do so by acquiring the voting power necessary to directly incentivise rewards to their stablecoin pools on these exchanges. They get that power by buying governance tokens. These protocols also rely on yield optimisers that can improve the base rewards on offer for liquidity providers.

Still, this ownership enables Reserve to optimise the rewards earned by users of the decentralised stablecoin exchange. Convex is built on top of Curve and holders of CVX are able to boost rewards to their chosen pools on Curve. StakeDAO is a DeFi yield optimiser that offers liquid locking \u2014 a solution that allows users to earn more yield on Curve and Convex tokens without compromising voting power or liquidity.

                "headline": "Ripple to face off against Circle, PayPal with new USD stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "headline": "DeFi investors punt nearly $1m into new Ethereum hybrid staking protocol offering 10% yield",
                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

                "body": " The DeFi stablecoin war is heating up. DeFi lending giant Aave looks set to challenge fellow DeFi heavyweights MakerDAO and Curve with the launch of its own US dollar stablecoin GHO, following the conclusion of a DAO vote. The vote, which ended on July 14, passed with near unanimous support from Aave DAO delegates, with 881,059 AAVE tokens used by supporters to back the proposal in contrast to 10 AAVE tokens against it. \u201cFollowing the approval of this [Aave Improvement Proposal] users of Aave V3 on Ethereum will be able to mint GHO against their collateral, kickstarting a new era for the Aave ecosystem and the Aave DAO,\u201d the proposal stated. GHO\u2019s launch on the Ethereum blockchain could happen as early as July 15 once the decision reached by the DAO is executed on-chain. GHO is an overcollateralised stablecoin \u2014 users submit crypto collateral in excess of the amount of the stablecoin they wish to mint. This excess collateral is determined by a collateral factor as prescribed by the protocol, designed to ensure the stablecoin keeps its peg amidst market fluctuations of the other assets it\u2019s hitched to. Once GHO is launched, it will join a group of DeFi-native stablecoins that has long been dominated by MakerDAO\u2019s DAI. Stablecoins are a staple of DeFi protocols, regardless of their size. They form base trading pairs on these protocols and can be used for lending and borrowing to generate yield for both users and the protocols themselves. Despite the ubiquity of protocol-native stablecoins, many of the largest DeFi players like Aave have previously not floated their own stable cryptocurrencies. MakerDAO and Frax Finance were the prominent outliers in this trend. NOW READ: DeFi\u2019s biggest exchange Curve Finance takes a shot at stablecoins Aave is the second-largest DeFi protocol with a total value locked of $5.9 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Total value locked is a DeFi metric that tracks the value of tokens locked into a protocol by users. Curve Finance, for its own part, is the largest stablecoin exchange and is a major hub for stablecoin liquidity. Curve recently launched its US dollar stablecoin called crvUSD and Aave is now set to follow suit. This could set the stage for an expanded DeFi stablecoin war among DAI, crvUSD, and GHO with Frax Finance\u2019s FRAX stablecoin not far behind. Yield generation could be at the centre of this tussle with each protocol devising means to incentivise interest in their respective stablecoins. The growing Ethereum liquid staking derivatives, or LSD token, market is likely to be a major component of these yield strategies. Major Ether LSDs, like Lido\u2019s stETH and Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, are already popular collateral for loans on DeFi lending protocols. The market size of these DeFi stablecoins put together still pales in comparison to Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin which currently dominates the market. USDT currently accounts for almost two-thirds of the $127 billion stablecoin market, according to DefiLlama data. It is, however, not a DeFi-native stablecoin as it is issued by a centralised entity. DeFi proponents have often pushed for a broader adoption of protocol-native stablecoins instead of USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC \u2014 the two major players. They point to how centralised stablecoin issuers can block transactions as part of the reasons why they prefer decentralised alternatives.

But it\u2019s not just audits that can make or break a stablecoin\u2019s rating. Bluechip looks at numerous factors, including how well a stablecoin has historically held its peg, how transparent its governance is, and the quality of its management, among other things. \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking at whether there are deep liquidity pools for each coin, although those are important traits,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking behind that to questions of governance.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just some sort of gut feeling about whether you like the team or not.\u201d That approach stems from Jones\u2019 background. He\u2019s a professor for the Study of Capitalism at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. He also helped bring together an advisory group of other economists, including Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Alex Tabarrok and Lawrence H. White, to work on Bluechip. Other advisers include Nic Carter, general partner at VC firm Castle Island Ventures, and Ameen Soleimani, co-founder of Reflexer Labs that develops stablecoin Rai. Jones is one of the three team members behind the agency \u2014 the others are Austria-based CEO Benjamin Levit, and India-based ratings director Vaidya Pallasena, an accountant by training. Bluechip has received donations from Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO behind stablecoin Dai; stablecoin issuance platform Reserve\u2019s co-founder Nevin Freeman; Ethereum scaling solution Starkware\u2019s co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson; InnovaticGroup and others.

Jones realises stablecoin rating is a contentious practice. Others in the industry may disagree with Bluechip\u2019s results, which are subject to change if a stablecoin\u2019s fundamentals improve or deteriorate. \u201cWe look forward to people disagreeing with us or agreeing with us, coming up with their own way of saying, \u2018we wish you had rated this a little bit differently,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cUltimately, one of our goals is to encourage stablecoin projects to feel like they will benefit if they just share more information.\u201d"

                "body": " The amount of Ether staked through liquid staking providers Rocket Pool and Frax Ether jumped, outpacing the growth of the industry leader, Lido. The Ether staked by DeFi users via Rocket Pool and Frax soared 38% each over the past month, DefiLlama data shows. That outpaces a 5% increase in Ether staked through the dominant industry player, Lido. The data is a sign that investors are opting for smaller players to stake their Ethereum, in part to chip away at Lido\u2019s dominance. Any one player having such weight in the market threatens Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation and heightens the risk of bad actors wrenching control. Domothy, a pseudonymous researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, told DL News that he hopes that Lido\u2019s recent move to enable staking withdrawals on May 15 \u201cbrings Lido dominance down as people seek to diversify into other pools or start solo staking.\u201d \u201cThis is definitely a good thing in terms of security and decentralisation,\u201d Domothy said. NOW READ: Tether nears its $84bn record \u2014 almost triple the value of rival USDC Since Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade, which for the first time allowed those staking their Ether to withdraw it from the network\u2019s staking contract, the amount of Ether staked has soared. Lido currently holds the title as the biggest single Ether staker, accounting for 30% of all staked Ether. Its dominance has stirred unease within the DeFi community, as many argue that concentrating a large portion of staked Ether in one place hurts Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Despite Rocket Pool and Frax Ether growing at a faster pace than Lido, they still trail in terms of total staking deposits. Over the past month, Lido\u2019s Ether deposits exceeded $600 million, compared to $460 million for Rocket Pool and $140 million for Frax Ether. Liquid staking protocols stake depositors\u2019 Ether and give them placeholder tokens, called liquid staking derivatives, in return. The main advantage of these liquid staking derivatives is that users can earn Ether staking rewards while also using their funds in other DeFi protocols, enhancing capital efficiency. Rocket Pool credits the protocol\u2019s recent Atlas upgrade as a key driver behind the increase in Ether staking deposits. Typically, stakers wanting to run an Ethereum validator need to stake a minimum of 32 Ether. However, Rocket Pool\u2019s Atlas upgrade has reduced this requirement to eight Ether for users, with Rocket Pool covering the remaining 24. \u201c[Atlas] further reduced our already low barrier to entry for node operators and greatly boosted protocol efficiency,\u201d Rocket Pool\u2019s marketing manager Nick Ashley told DL News. \u201cThe growing list of powerful DeFi integrations is making our liquid staking token rETH an increasingly attractive option too,\u201d he said. As for Frax Ether, the protocol\u2019s high staking yields seem to be attracting new investors. Investors can currently earn about 7% annually on their staked Ether through Frax, compared to 5.2% through Rocket Pool and 5.4% through Lido, according to DefiLlama data. The integration of Frax Ether by other DeFi protocols could also be boosting its adoption. For instance, the decentralised exchange Curve Finance, which recently launched its crvUSD stablecoin, has selected Frax Ether as the first asset that users can deposit to mint crvUSD. NOW READ: DeFi\u2019s biggest exchange Curve Finance takes a shot at stablecoins Domothy anticipates that the surge in Ether staking post-Shapella will continue. \u201cThe fact that withdrawals are now possible helped de-risk staking, so the more conservative crowd are more comfortable,\u201d Domothy said. \u201cThose who were waiting to exit have by and large finished doing so, now the beacon chain validator count is up only.\u201d"

                "body": " Curve Finance, the biggest decentralised exchange in DeFi, forges ahead with its newest launch: a decentralised stablecoin designed to offer an alternative to the centrally-controlled market leaders such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC. Curve\u2019s new stablecoin, called crvUSD, works similarly to Maker\u2019s DAI, but introduces a new way to handle insolvent positions which should help reduce volatility in the crypto market. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty novel model, so I think we need to proceed carefully,\u201d Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, told DL News. NOW READ: Wintermute hacker turns $160m heist into top liquidity position on Curve Finance Curve first deployed the code for the new stablecoin on Ethereum on May 3. However, it held off on the full launch to iron out bugs within the protocol. It turned out such caution was not unwarranted. Curve had to redeploy three times in the leadup to the full launch after users discovered bugs. \u201cOf course it is well tested and audited, but nothing can replace battle-testing,\u201d Egorov said. On Wednesday, Curve launched a frontend for crvUSD, letting users easily deposit collateral and mint the new stablecoin at the click of a button. Curve is an unchangeable protocol deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which lets users trustlessly trade crypto tokens with each other. It\u2019s an automated market maker \u2014 DeFi\u2019s alternative to order books. Supported by other pieces of code like liquidity pools, which are smart contracts holding deposits, AMMs help facilitate token trades by rebalancing the price as sell and buy orders change the token supply within the liquidity pools. Curve specialises in swaps of like-assets \u2014 such as stablecoins and different versions of wrapped tokens \u2014 providing efficient trading between them. \u201cCurve was built for stablecoins, so it\u2019s huge that the largest, battle-tested [automated market maker] introduces a stablecoin,\u201d Julien Bouteloup, a Curve contributor, told DL News. NOW READ: Merlin\u2019s $1.8m heist highlights role of code auditor CertiK: \u2018This should have been captured\u2019 CrvUSD, uses a similar mechanism to the Maker protocol and its DAI stablecoin. Users can lock up volatile assets like Ether as collateral to mint dollar-pegged crvUSD tokens equal to a portion of the collateral\u2019s value. In the world of traditional finance, stablecoins like crvUSD and DAI are similar to collateralised debt positions \u2014 or CDPs. Under Maker\u2019s model, if the value of a user\u2019s collateral drops below a predetermined threshold, the protocol enables third parties to liquidate the user\u2019s position to ensure it doesn\u2019t lose money. One of the main ways Curve\u2019s new stablecoin differs from DAI is in what Egorov calls the Lending-Liquidating AMM Algorithm \u2014 or LLAMMA \u2014 in his whitepaper outlining the stablecoin. Under the LLAMMA model, instead of liquidating a user\u2019s collateral all at once when a certain level is reached, the protocol will gradually convert collateral over time. Additionally, if the prices of users\u2019 collateral assets start to recover, reducing the danger of the protocol losing money, it will automatically start to buy back the collateral it sold. According to the crvUSD whitepaper, LLAMMA should help reduce losses for users who face liquidation and stop large chunks of collateral hitting the market all at once, decreasing volatility. \u201cLLAMMA is built to handle liquidations during wild price swings without big collateral losses,\u201d Bouteloup said. \u201c[It\u2019s] not great for liquidators like me but awesome for retail users, avoiding cascade liquidation drama.\u201d Currently, users can only deposit Ether staked through DeFi protocol Frax Finance \u2014 sfrxETH \u2014 to mint crvUSD. But Curve will need to introduce more collateral assets in the future if it wants to scale. \u201cA major challenge is scalability,\u201d Will Sheehan, founder of DeFi analytics platform Parsec, told DL News. Sheehan said that by initiating sfrxETH as collateral, Curve is focusing on Ether LSDs, or liquid staking derivatives, but questioned the approach in the long term. \u201cHow far can that get them compared to more liquid and pooled models like Aave that already have the major [LSDs] integrated?\u201d Sheehan said. Indeed, Aave, currently the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum, has already enabled major Ether LSDs \u2014 such as Lido staked Ether and Rocket Pool staked Ether \u2014 as collateral for loans. Aave also has plans to launch its own stablecoin, but is yet to set a date for the launch. NOW READ: DeFi insurer Sherlock teeters on the edge after reserves fall 90% Currently, the biggest debate surrounding crvUSD is what other assets, besides sfrxETH, its developers will enable as collateral. \u201cOne of the more significant challenges that crvUSD will face in its adoption is supporting the right collateral types,\u201d bb8, a pseudonymous team member at Curve ecosystem protocol Conic Finance, told DL News. \u201cBy determining how crvUSD is minted, these parameters will shape the growth of crvUSD liquidity and adoption,\u201d bb8 said. But for Egorov and the other Curve developers, exercising caution is the most important thing. He said Curve is limiting collateral types and market sizes initially as part of its careful approach. Even with a guarded launch and competitors like Aave biting at Curve\u2019s heels, Egorov is optimistic. \u201cI think it has great adoption prospects,\u201d he said.

                "body": " Staked Ether levels have dropped by $1.3 billion over the past week after the blockchain\u2019s upgrade dubbed Shapella enabled withdrawals. Investors withdrew 1.36 million Ether valued at around $2.6 billion and deposited only 714,290 Ether worth $1.4 billion in the week after Shapella went live \u2014 a net outflow of 647,050 coins, according to data from TokenUnlocks. While some analysts had anticipated the upgrade would trigger a sell-off after the upgrade led to more tokens in the market, its price has remained relatively stable. Since the commencement of withdrawals last week, the second-largest cryptocurrency has seen a moderate price increase of approximately 1.5%, currently trading around $1,970. \u201cETH often has more than $10 billion of trading volume on a single day,\u201d Patrick Scott, a crypto analyst, told DL News. \u201cThe outflows are likely less consequential than normal crypto market volatility.\u201d READ NOW: Fallen crypto king Do Kwon slapped with fake passport charge in Montenegro The withdrawals from Ethereum\u2019s staking contract are likely far from over. In order to keep Ethereum secure, the network limits the number of withdrawals that can take place concurrently. This means those who wish to withdraw their Ether must enter a withdrawal queue. Based on the amount of Ether currently in line for full withdrawals, those entering the queue now will need to wait over two weeks before receiving their Ether. Data from crypto analytics platform Nansen shows that 741,750 Ether, worth approximately $1.4 billion, is currently queued for full withdrawal. Of this amount, 68% of withdrawals are due to come from Coinbase, Binance and Kraken \u2014 the top three centralised exchanges that stake Ether on behalf of their customers. Although stakers are in the process of withdrawing billions of Ether, the outflows may not be leaving the market altogether. Data from DefiLlama highlights significant inflows into so-called liquid staking services such as Lido, Rocket Pool, and StakeWise. READ NOW: \u2018Sandwich bots\u2019 filch millions off unwitting investors during meme coin rally These decentralised protocols allow users to stake Ether and receive staking tokens \u2013 like token receipts \u2013 in return, such as stETH for Lido and rETH for Rocket Pool. Staking tokens often trade close to the price of Ether, but they aren\u2019t pegged \u2013 fixed to the price of Ether \u2013 by design. Lido, the leading liquid staking derivative provider, has experienced a surge in the amount of Ether staked via its protocol, with a notable 2.2% increase over the past week. This uptick is equivalent to roughly 120,000 additional Ether worth about $236 million, demonstrating a significant shift in investor sentiment towards liquid staking services. Elsewhere Rocket Pool, the third-biggest liquid staking token provider, registered an inflow of about 7%. Two smaller liquid staking protocols \u2014 ether.fi and Frax Ether \u2014 have also seen gains of about 21% and 14%, respectively, in the same period. However, cbETH, or Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH, the only liquid staking token issued by a centralised exchange, saw its supply decrease 2.7% in the same period. In recent months, liquid staking services have garnered significant popularity, largely due to their ability to allow stakers to employ their staking tokens \u2013 and consequently, the staked Ether by extension \u2013 across various other DeFi protocols. Several DeFi lending protocols including Aave accept these tokens as collateral to issue cryptocurrency loans."

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here.

One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%.

Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year.

Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack.

But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Lower market cap cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases overnight as investors returned to the market after last week's liquidation event.\nTrading volumes in crypto are showing no signs of recovery, however, and moves higher could be exacerbated by the low liquidity.",
                "body": " Happy Thursday! Crypto markets recovered some of last week\u2019s losses overnight. Altcoins had sharper increases than Bitcoin and Ethereum as investors appeared to favour lower market capitalisation cryptocurrencies. Spot trading volumes are on track for their worst month since October 2020. Let\u2019s dig in. Crypto markets recovered some of their losses after prices crashed last week, but volumes show no signs of recovering. Bitcoin and Ethereum moved higher overnight, trading around $26,400 and $1,600 respectively. Investors appeared to favour altcoins, so-called lower-market value cryptocurrencies. Solana\u2019s SOL was one of the biggest winners, adding over 4.4% to trade around $21.70. The markets move higher comes just one week after prices crashed and traders saw long and short positions liquidated to the tune of $1 billion. Spot trading volumes for August are just $325 billion, according to The Block Research data. Volumes have been consistently low since May when they reached multi-year lows. Volumes are on course to register their lowest month since October 2020. The low liquidity environment at present might explain the sharp price moves. During periods of low liquidity, markets are prone to sharp moves. Crypto data firm Kaiko said Monday that despite being more stable, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth is still 50% below its pre-FTX highs. As prices moved lower last Thursday, Bitcoin\u2019s market depth plunged to 2,000 BTC from 5,000 BTC. Market depth measures the number of orders within a price range waiting to be filled. Kaiko views depth as one of the most important gauges of liquidity. The research firm sums bids and asks within 2% of the mid-price to assess the depth of the Bitcoin market. \u201cMarket depth has become much more concentrated, with the top five most liquid venues accounting for 77% share in Bitcoin and Ethereum market depth compared to 68% before the collapse of FTX,\u201d Kaiko said, referring to the top crypto exchanges. \u201cThis could exacerbate price moves during periods of market turmoil,\u201d the report said. On-chain the picture is much worse, Kaiko added. Since the beginning of June, almost $200 million has been removed from the 3pool and $800 million worth of tokens have been removed from the stETH-ETH pool. Total value locked stood at $225 million and $340 million respectively on Monday, the pools have \u201cvacated the top spot on Curve, now held by FRAX-USDC,\u201d Kaiko noted.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve. (Llama Airforce) VOTE: CoW Swap to embark on a 6-month period to test promising fee models PROPOSAL: Aave mulls Solana deployment through Neon EVM VOTE: Uniswap chooses members for its Deployments Accountability Committee Celestia co-founder Mustafa Al-Bassam reminisces about his past exploits as a member of hacker group LulzSec. In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack.

But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks.

While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "headline": "Illicit activity in Ethereum staking is low. It\u2019s still enough to spook big finance firms",
                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week.

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

If you want to read this or our other newsletters before your friends do, don\u2019t hesitate to sign up. Hey everyone, Tim here. Welcome back to The Decentralised, where we attempt to make sense of all the top DeFi shenanigans that took place over the past week. Last Friday, Ekin Gen\u00e7 and Adam Morgan McCarthy broke the news that hackers drained $870,000 from celebrity entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. Onchain movements first pointed out by pseudonymous crypto sleuth @WazzCrypto put Ekin and Adam on the trail, who then followed up with Cuban himself to confirm the hack. NOW READ: Serial \u2018pig butchering\u2019 scam victim loses almost $10m in crypto despite warnings Cuban attributed the hack to him downloading a fake version of the popular non-custodial wallet MetaMask. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I downloaded a version of MetaMask with some shit in it,\u201d he told DL News, explaining he had searched for Circle on Google, not MetaMask. But how did a seasoned investor and crypto user like Cuban end up downloading malware? From what Cuban told us, we believe a phishing link in a search engine like Google\u2019s sponsored advertisements is the most likely culprit. Hackers targeting crypto users often create fake versions of popular sites like Uniswap, MetaMask, and even DefiLlama. The fake sites use very similar URLs to the real ones, making them difficult to detect at a glance. The fake sites are designed to drain the wallets of unsuspecting users or get them to download malware which steals their private keys. A fake DefiLlama website on Microsoft Bing search results. Be careful! Cuban was unaware his wallet had been hacked when approached by DL News. By alerting him early, he was able to transfer about $2.5 million of assets and several valuable NFTs the hacker initially missed to the safety of his Coinbase account. Although the hack cost him almost a million, the damage could\u2019ve been a lot worse. It\u2019s rare for such a high-profile figure to fall victim to a hack, but malicious search engine ads targeting crypto users aren\u2019t new. There are reports of such scams dating back as far as 2021. DL News recommends bookmarking the URLs of crypto and DeFi sites you use so you never get caught out by a rogue ad. We\u2019re trying to reach google for comment and will keep you posted. Next up, Aleks Gilbert investigated Coinbase\u2019s buzzy layer 2 blockchain Base, and how it plans to maintain user activity after the end of its Onchain Summer rewards programme. Aleks pointed out that after the end of similar rewards programmes on rival layer 2s Arbitrum and Optimism, activity on those chains plummeted. Personally, I don\u2019t think Base has much to worry about. It\u2019s got some solid use cases which transcend the financial merry-go-round of mercenary capital looking for the best incentives and yield. The obvious one is Friend.tech, the crypto-based social media platform that lets users buy and sell shares \u2014 called keys \u2014 of X personalities. NOW READ: She lost $80,000 in a crypto romance scam. Now she\u2019s fighting back At its core, Friend.tech is a way for personalities to monetise their attention. The results are immediate, quantifiable and come with some serious bragging rights in the form of how much a user\u2019s key is worth. Beyond Friend.tech, there are some less talked about uses for Base, too. Parallel, a sci-fi collectible card game reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, is also making inroads by selling starter decks on Base. Since Parallel launched its closed beta at the start of August, the price of its PRIME currency token, used to buy items and perks in-game, has soared. Lastly, DL News\u2019 in-house researcher Tyler Pearson put together a detailed list of every single hack attributed to the North Korean cybercrime syndicate Lazarus Group (spoiler alert: there\u2019s a lot). Over the past 16 years, the group has swiped a colossal $3.4 billion in crypto, mostly from crypto companies and investors. So far in 2023, Lazarus has been blamed for at least $256 million stolen in crypto hacks. NOW READ: How North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group used a fake job offer to steal $37m from CoinsPaid In recent weeks, some have doubted whether super coders from the hermit kingdom are really behind all the hacks attributed to them by the US government. Sceptics point to North Korea\u2019s relative lack of technical capabilities as reason to doubt such claims. While I\u2019m a big proponent of the \u201cdon\u2019t trust, verify\u201d mentality, especially when it comes to governments, I think Lazarus really are behind the hacks. In Michael Lewis\u2019 Flash Boys he highlights the strange phenomenon of Russians who grew up under Soviet rule becoming some of the world\u2019s best computer programmers, despite having far fewer resources at their disposal. There are a few different theories as to why this was the case, but regardless of which is correct, I think a similar thing is happening in North Korea today. Be sure to read Ty\u2019s full story here for a year-by-year breakdown and comments from leading cybersecurity experts. Lazarus Group remains at large, but in 2023 the group stole substantially less in crypto hacks than in 2022. A big reason why 2022 was such a bad year was due to Lazarus\u2019 $625 million Ronin bridge heist in March. Another reason is that the value of stolen assets \u2014 specifically altcoins \u2014 has fallen along with crypto prices. As awareness of Lazarus\u2019 tactics spreads \u2014 such as using social engineering techniques and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn \u2014 hopefully fewer firms will fall victim to them in the future.

PROPOSAL: Frax floats similar staking yields to MakerDAO\u2019s DSR The Frax core team wants to introduce sFRAX, a staked version of the protocol\u2019s stablecoin that earns interest. The proposal says sFRAX will target (but not guarantee) the same returns as the Federal Reserve Interest on Reserve Deposit Rate. A close encounter with alleged alien bodies in Mexico caused a stir last week. Although the bodies have been widely discredited as a hoax (a report debunking them claimed they\u2019re fakes made from, among other things, llama bones), the humour of the situation didn\u2019t escape the crypto community. Dozen of accounts on Crypto Twitter used pictures of the aliens to do what they do best: create memes. Arbitrum\u2019s DAO has voted to allocate 50 million ARB tokens \u2014 currently worth about $41.5 million \u2014 to projects building on the layer 2 chain.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "headline": "Ripple to face off against Circle, PayPal with new USD stablecoin",
                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Frax profit from high bond yields.\nSuch protocols stand to make even more if interest rates keep rising.\nElsewhere, the high-rate environment continues to have a negative impact on the wider DeFi ecosystem.",
                "body": " Agile players in decentralised finance are seizing on lucrative trades in the bond market as yields on 30-year Treasuries hit their highest level since 2007 While the move is a signal of weakness in global economies, yields of over 5.5% on short-dated bonds have lured DeFi juggernauts including MakerDAO, the fourth-largest protocol with $4.5 billion of investor deposits. Over the past year, MakerDAO has committed to a bold strategy: holding US Treasury bonds, in addition to generating yield by lending out its Dai stablecoin. The result: MakerDAO can offer its users some of the highest yields in DeFi through its dollar-pegged Dai stablecoin while still generating a healthy profit for the protocol. \u201cThe protocol is effectively running a carry trade,\u201d TJ Ragsdale, co-founder of Entheos Network and previous real world assets manager at MakerDAO, told DL News. \u201cIt mints Dai at the prevailing cost of capital, and lends it to the US government for a higher rate, pocketing the spread.\u201d MakerDAO\u2019s strategy appears to be working. According to MakerDAO analytics platform Makerburn.com, the protocol stood to generate an annual profit of about $23 million at the start of the year. That figure has now more than tripled since to $73 million. MakerDAO fees and revenue chart (Makerburn.com) And according to Ragsdale, if rates keep rising, the profitability of Maker\u2019s carry trade on newly purchased US treasuries increases. At the same time, much of MakerDAO\u2019s revenue gets routed back to Dai holders through the eDSR, or enhanced Dai savings rate, a mechanism where Dai holders can lock up their tokens to earn yield. The eDSR currently yields a 5% annual return. \u201cIf yields improve, eDSR will improve too,\u201d Raphael Spannocchi, a DAO governance researcher at Flipside, told DL News. \u201cMost of the treasuries are short-term, so Maker can follow pretty quickly.\u201d Other DeFi protocols are taking note. Frax Finance, another DeFi protocol that issues its own stablecoin, just passed a governance vote to implement a similar system to the Dai savings rate, but for its own stablecoin, Frax. Like MakerDAO, the Frax yield primarily comes from the protocol\u2019s bond holdings through outside entities. The high-interest rate environment is a key catalyst driving innovation in interest-bearing stablecoins such as Dai and Frax, said Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co. \u201cThey have to be more competitive to retain users from fleeing to earn a risk-free rate from US Treasuries,\u201d he told DL News. Wan noted that since the US Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022, the market cap of crypto stablecoins has dropped 33%. stablecoins total market cap chart (DefiLlama) And it\u2019s not just stablecoins that are suffering. Outside of havens like MakerDAO and Frax, the high-rate environment is having a negative effect on the wider DeFi ecosystem. Investor deposits across DeFi are down 77% from their 2021 highs, according to DefiLlama data. Trading volumes at decentralised exchanges have also cratered. \u201cInterest rate hikes generally hurt risk assets, including other DeFi protocols,\u201d Ragsdale said, adding that further rate hikes will be more damaging to non-Maker protocols that can\u2019t take advantage of them. Others, such as Tadeo, developer relations manager for MakerDAO\u2019s Spark Protocol, share a similar view. \u201cIf UST yields go higher, protocols that do not embrace them will keep losing competitiveness,\u201d he said. Tadeo explained that the most successful protocols are those that integrate sDAI \u2014 the yield bearing version of Dai \u2014 into their offerings. But while such protocols are enjoying their moment in the sun, the strategy of relying on high interest rates could be a double-edged sword. Because if and when bond yields drop, the yield offered on stablecoins like Dai and Frax is likely to drop, too. Have a tip on DeFi? Contact the author at tim@dlnews.com."

                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors.

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "headline": "Illicit activity in Ethereum staking is low. It\u2019s still enough to spook big finance firms",
                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "headline": "Arbitrum is looking for yield. BlackRock came knocking",
                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. why don\u2019t we build something that takes 10-15% of that market share Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "keypoints": "Staking surges after Ethereum's Shapella upgrade.\nLido took off after staking risks diminished.",
                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. why don\u2019t we build something that takes 10-15% of that market share Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "headline": "Arbitrum is looking for yield. BlackRock came knocking",
                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "headline": "Restaking mania sends EigenLayer deposits past $1bn",
                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "headline": "Arbitrum is looking for yield. BlackRock came knocking",
                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "keypoints": "Blast prepares to unlock $2 billion in Ether and stablecoins.\nUniswap fee switch inspires others to follow suit.\nEthena begins Phase Two of its airdrop campaign.",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "headline": "Why 163-year-old ratings firm S&P suddenly decided to rank stablecoin Tether",
                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year.

                "headline": "Illicit activity in Ethereum staking is low. It\u2019s still enough to spook big finance firms",
                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here.

The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

In traditional finance, such antics might make investors think twice. But in crypto, they seem to add to a project\u2019s appeal, or at least don\u2019t seem to spook investors \u2014 Celestia\u2019s TIA token just hit an all-time high of over $20.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. why don\u2019t we build something that takes 10-15% of that market share Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "keypoints": "The $48 million KyberSwap exploiter writes an unhinged ultimatum\nStarknet confirms airdrop eligibility leak\nA new DeFi project raises \u2014 but refuses VC money",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. why don\u2019t we build something that takes 10-15% of that market share Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000. NodeMonkes slide into the fifth highest floor price for profile picture NFTs (Coingecko/Coingecko) PROPOSAL: GMX explores launching their own low fee blockchain VOTE: AAVE DAO doubles rewards given to stkGHO PROPOSAL: SYN DAO proposes a $1 million one-time buyback and future monthly buybacks Popular crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy Crypto, engaged in a striking match against James Slammeron on February 24. Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "keypoints": "PayPal\u2019s PYUSD integrates with DeFi stalwart\nHarmony devs fling threats after bug mints $2.2 million in extra tokens\nIs DeFi interoperability about to go mainstream?",
                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

                "headline": "Arbitrum is looking for yield. BlackRock came knocking",
                "keypoints": "Arbitrum DAO wants exposure to real-world assets.\nSome TradFi firms have volunteered their services.",
                "body": " The digital cooperatives that run much of the crypto economy tend to hire crypto-native companies when they need a security audit, help managing their finances, and other services. But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "keypoints": "The Hundred Finance hacker is converting their stolen funds into Ether.\nThe hacker could be preparing to cash out some of their loot.",
                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "keypoints": "Asymmetry Finance's afETH is a hybrid staking token, offering a 10.2% annual yield by blending sfrxETH and vlCVX tokens.\nThe protocol plans to restake its sfrxETH through EigenLayer when deposits reopen.\nThe strategy behind afETH involves a number of risks due to the integration of vlCVX.",
                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

                "keypoints": "S&P's chief DeFi officer told DL News stablecoin users bemoan issuers' lack of understanding around risk.\nAnalysts favoured issuers such as Circle with high transparency and regulatory oversight.\nTether, Frax, True USD, and FDUSD received relatively poor ratings.",
                "body": " S&P Global, one of the top three credit rating firms, faulted Tether on Tuesday for a reliance on \u201criskier assets\u201d backing USDT, its stablecoin. The firm\u2019s analysts also panned Tether for the \u201climited transparency\u201d of the entities that serve as its custodians, counterparties, or banks. By ranking Tether near the bottom of its rating scale, S&P Global underscored longtime criticisms of the most widely held and valuable stablecoin worldwide. Tether\u2019s USDT sports a market capitalisation of $91 billion. In a move that may help standardise the $130 billion stablecoin market, S&P Global launched its own batch of stablecoin ratings this week. The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third.

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain.

                "keypoints": "A new report finds Ethereum liquid staking providers are exposed to illicit funds at a very low level.\n'The dark number is probably significantly higher,' Northstake head of compliance Sebastian Heine said.\nIllicit funds could raise concerns for institutional investors.",
                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?

But a pair of firms with ties to Wall Street entered the messy world of DAO governance this past weekend when they offered to help Arbitrum DAO diversify its holdings. The year-old DAO \u2014 short for decentralised autonomous organisation, ostensibly leaderless organisations run by token holders \u2014 wants to invest 35 million ARB tokens, worth about $37 million, for stable, liquid assets that \u201cprovide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \u2018risk free rate of return\u2019 of US Treasuries.\u201d In an open call that ended Sunday, more than two dozen companies pitched their own products. The list includes DeFi protocol Frax, and real-world asset companies Ondo and Centrifuge. But it also included two surprises: Franklin Templeton, the Wall Street-born, trillion-dollar asset manager, and Securitize, a seven-year-old company that has been helping the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with its push to tokenise assets like stocks and bonds by bringing them onto a blockchain. It\u2019s just the latest example of more traditional financial institutions \u2014 \u201cTradFi\u201d in crypto industry shorthand \u2014 wading deeper into the crypto economy. While some have experimented with bespoke, private blockchains or offered Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, few engage directly with DAOs, cooperatives whose public and occasionally contentious decision-making often make headlines. \u201cIncredible effort from the @arbitrum DAO and the team at @OffchainLabs to get institutions comfortable with submitting a proposal on a public forum,\u201d Ryan de Souza, who focuses on partnerships at Arbitrum parent company Offchain Labs, wrote on X. \u201cWhat started out as a brainstorming session around providing support for RWA teams, turned into an amazing governance proposal and participation across DeFi and TradFi teams looking to bring RWAs to Arbitrum,\u201d he added, using the acronym for real-world assets. Dubbed the Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program, or STEP for short, the initiative grew from conversations with protocols on the Arbitrum blockchain, according to the DAO\u2019s request for applications. \u201cOur conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product,\u201d the request reads. \u201cAnother way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum.\u201d The tokenisation of real-world assets was one of the most talked-about uses of blockchain technology in 2023, though it has contracted this year with the return of crypto\u2019s bull market and high-risk, high-reward trades. Nevertheless, it continues to have its proponents, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \u201cThe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be the tokenisation of securities,\u201d Fink said during a DealBook event in 2022. In its STEP application, Securitize pitched BUIDL, BlackRock\u2019s $381 million, Ethereum-based tokenised fund, which recently overtook Franklin Templeton\u2019s FOBXX as the largest in the industry, according to data from RWA.xyz. Securitize said it isn\u2019t exactly a stranger to DAOs. \u201cAs a top 10 transfer agent, Securitize has worked with a considerable list of crypto-native firms, notably working through what [know-your-customer] processes and requirements look like for DAOs,\u201d Jonathan Espinosa, the firm\u2019s director of investments, wrote in the application. Franklin Templeton pitched FOBXX, whose BENJI tokens live on the Stellar and Polygon blockchains. The company, which once submitted a similar proposal in the MakerDAO forum, also touted its crypto experience. \u201cWe have operated nodes on both the Provenance and Stellar blockchains since 2019,\u201d Franklin Templeton wrote in its application. \u201cIn 2021, we began operating node validators and staking on four additional Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks: Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot. In 2023, we began supporting Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche and Arbitrum.\u201d A committee of several organisations with deep experience in DAO governance will review the applications, and is expected to make a decision in June.

                "body": " In April last year, a hacker exploited a bug in Optimism-based DeFi protocol Hundred Finance, making off with $7.4 million. After over a year of silence, the stolen funds are now on the move. At around 10:25 am London time on Wednesday, the hacker withdrew almost $800,000 worth of Ether and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin from decentralised exchange Curve after using the tokens to provide liquidity there over a year ago. Following the withdrawal, the hacker used decentralised exchange Uniswap to swap the USDT, as well as smaller amounts of other cryptocurrencies like PAXG, WOO, FRAX and DAI into Ether. In total, the transactions increased the wallet\u2019s Ether holdings by just over $1 million. The hacker now holds $4.2 million worth of Ether, $1.2 million DAI, $859,000 of Synthetix\u2019s sUSD stablecoin, and smaller amounts of Wrapped Ether, FRAX, SNX, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Why the hacker suddenly decided to start moving funds after all this time isn\u2019t known. If the hacker is still in control of the wallet and behind the transactions, it could signal they are preparing to cash out the stolen funds. Hackers often convert stolen crypto into Bitcoin or Ether in order to more easily swap it for fiat currency. It may be increasingly difficult for the hacker to cash out their stolen crypto. Before attempting to cash out funds through a centralised crypto exchange, the hacker will need to break the chain of traceability that links the funds to the wallet that conducted the hack. Previously, hackers have relied on crypto mixers such as Samourai Wallet or privacy protocols like Tornado Cash to launder funds. But regulators worldwide are cracking down on ways crypto users can obfuscate their transaction histories. On April 24, the European Parliament voted to ban crypto mixers as part of new anti-money laundering regulations. Then on April 25, the DoJ charged two founders of crypto mixer Samourai Wallet with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. In the case like Samourai Wallet, US authorities took control of the crypto mixer\u2019s servers, leaving it inoperable. The enforcement actions have also dissuaded users from using crypto mixers and privacy protocols. In September 2022, developers at privacy protocol Tornado Cash told crypto security firm Elliptic that low liquidity on the protocol meant that users were struggling to mix even $100. Hundred Finance was a protocol forked from popular lending protocol Compound v2 that let users lend and borrow crypto. On April 15 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Hundred Finance\u2019s code to steal approximately $7.4 million from depositors. The hacker exploited a rounding error in how the protocol processed withdrawals, letting them use a small amount of Wrapped Bitcoin as collateral to withdraw more assets then they should have been able to. Following the exploit, Hundred Finance first offered a $500,000 open bounty for information that could lead to the arrest of the hacker and the retrieval of the stolen assets. Later, the protocol attempted to negotiate a return of the funds by offering the hacker 10% of the stolen funds, around $740,000, for the safe return of the remaining 90%. Both attempts to recover the stolen funds failed, and Hundred Finance token holders voted to shut the project down on August 9. Tim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News. Got a tip?

                "keypoints": "Ripple is launching a fiat-backed stablecoin.\nThe company plans to integrate the stablecoins with its payments platform to make everyday use easier.\nIt will face off against a wave of players entering the stablecoin space.",
                "body": " Ripple will launch a new stablecoin later this year. The company behind the XRP Ledger blockchain broke the news on Thursday, betting that integrating it with its payments platform RippleNet will enable users to use it for everyday expenses \u2014 eventually, anyway. Ripple\u2019s new bet comes as the stablecoin space is growing increasingly crowded, leaving the venture to face off against competitors like Circle and PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t think winner-take-all is realistic,\u201d David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s chief technology officer, told DL News. \u201cWith institutional adoption, nobody wants to build their business on one partner.\u201d Stablecoins are one of the few applications of crypto technology to have found traction in the real world. Last year, Bernstein predicted the $150 million market would balloon to almost $3 trillion by 2028. Startups and legacy companies alike are scrambling to grab a slice. Last month, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenised money market on Ethereum; its tokens are valued at $1 apiece. With yield hovering around 35%, Ethena\u2019s months-old \u201csynthetic dollar,\u201d USDe, is fast approaching a market capitalisation of $2 billion. And this week, Agora, a startup led by former Frax developer Nick Van Eck, the son of VanEck founder Jan Van Eck, said it had raised $12 million to build its own fiat-backed stablecoin. His father\u2019s eponymous firm will manage a fund for the stablecoin\u2019s reserves. DeFi stalwarts Liquity and Reflexer announced new iterations of existing stablecoins this year. And last year, DeFi giants Aave and Curve launched their own stablecoins, as did payments behemoth PayPal. However, using stablecoins is a clunky prospect. Users typically have to redeem a stablecoin for fiat currency in order to pay for real-world goods and services. While Ripple\u2019s sales pitch centres around the idea that the RippleNet integration will make everyday transactions smoother, that\u2019s a long-term vision, rather than a feature users can expect at launch, Schwartz said. Like Circle\u2019s USDC and Tether\u2019s USDT, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Ripple said its reserves will be audited by a third-party accounting firm and that it will publish monthly attestations. Ripple\u2019s XRP has long been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value. But it\u2019s also mired Ripple in years of litigation against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sued Ripple in 2020, alleging the company\u2019s distribution of XRP was an unregistered security offering. Ripple scored a partial victory in July, when a judge decided that XRP\u2019s sale on the exchange did not constitute an unregistered security, while sales to sophisticated investors did. Last month, the SEC said the company has continued to sell its associated XRP token to institutional investors, and asked a federal judge to fine Ripple Labs almost $2 billion.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on February 27. Sign up here. GM, Ryan here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi eye recently: Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created by the team behind NFT marketplace Blur, is launching its mainnet on February 29. Blast\u2019s key feature is that it offers native yield for Ether and stablecoins, derived from the Ether staking yield and MakeroDAO\u2019s onchain T-bill protocol. Prior to its launch, more than 3,000 protocols participated in Blast\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d competition, where projects building on Blast were critiqued by a panel of judges. Some 50% of the future community airdrop is allocated to its winners and future Blast mainnet protocols. Since launching on November 20, Blast has reached over $2 billion in total value of crypto assets deposited, but users haven\u2019t been able to withdraw. Until the mainnet goes live, deposits have been locked in Blast while they earn points, which will convert to tokens in May 2024. With the unlock just days away, protocols launching on Blast have the opportunity to attract users and capital from what will be the second largest layer 2 by total value locked. The price of UNI, Uniswap\u2019s governance token, increased nearly 70% in one day as Erin Koen, the governance lead at Uniswap Foundation, put forth a proposal to activate the fee switch. The Uniswap Foundation is a nonprofit organisation that supports the growth of Uniswap. In October, the foundation received 10.7 million UNI, now worth $113 million, to provide grants to ecosystem participants. The proposal will direct a portion of trading fees generated by Uniswap to UNI token holders who stake their tokens. Since its launch in November 2018, Uniswap has generated close to $5 billion in fees. In the last week, Uniswap had $8.9 billion in total volume, generating close to $20 million in fees. This proposal has already inspired a number of other protocols to consider turning on their fee switches. Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of Blur, an NFT marketplace with 77% of the total NFT volume in the last week, said in a post on X that the Blur community will be looking to learn from Uniswap\u2019s experience. Back in October, Arca Investments, a crypto investment firm, posted a lengthy governance proposal on activating a 1% fee switch. Frax Finance, the project behind stablecoin FRAX, also took to X, posing the question of whether protocol revenue should be sent to stakers of Frax\u2019s governance token FXS. Ethena, the project behind an Ethereum \u201csynthetic dollar\u201d USDe, began Phase Two of its shard campaign today. Ethena\u2019s shard campaign is similar to points campaigns like those offered by EigenLayer, where the expectation is that shards will convert to Ethena governance tokens in the future. USDe is backed by Ether and Ether derivatives, and can be minted with $1 in Ether, unlike other Ether-backed stablecoins, which require over-collateralization. Phase One of the campaign, from February 19 to 26, saw the total circulating supply of USDe rise to over $453 million while offering stakers a 24% annual yield. In the first phase, users earned a certain number of shards per day for staking USDe, buying and holding USDe, or providing USDe liquidity on decentralised exchange Curve Finance. For Phase Two, Ethena is increasing the amount of USDe that can be locked to earn shards, adding a new Curve liquidity pool, and rewarding users for depositing USDe in yield trading market, Pendle. Last week, Ethena ignited a debate about whether USDe should be considered a stablecoin. DL News\u2019 Aleks Gilbert covered the details here. The most popular Ordinals project, NodeMonkes, just moved into the fifth largest profile picture NFT collection by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. Ordinals is a protocol that allows users create NFTs and crypto tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the last month, NodeMonkes have risen from 0.15 Bitcoin to 0.40 Bitcoin, or about $20,000.

Slammeron is the lead developer of the memecoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, which trades under the ticker $BITCOIN \u2014 not to be confused with the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Armstrong won the three-round fight, causing $BITCOIN to fall from $0.051 to $0.043. That\u2019s an almost 16% drop in only 15 minutes. $BEN surged more than 60%. As trader Andrew Kang pointed out, the performance of $BITCOIN and $BEN following the results of this fight may indicate a wider trend, where memecoins are evolving into SocialFi attention markets. The first user interface for Curve\u2019s new lending product, LlamaLend, was deployed by the team at DeFi Saver, a DeFi management tool. LlamaLend will help to increase the crvUSD supply, as users deposit tokens like wstETH, CRV, and tBTC to borrow crvUSD. crvUSD has evolved into a key revenue driver for the Curve DAO, generating $4.6 million in fees since launching in May 2023.

                "body": " As the competition between Ethereum liquid staking protocols intensifies, projects are coming up with new ways to enhance the yields they offer. One protocol \u2014 Asymmetry Finance \u2014 is trying to lure in investors with a hybrid approach. Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%. Launched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap. Although afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether. Asymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more. Liquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024. The flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols. Liquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols. EigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024. EigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14. Asymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement. Assymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH. Since EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly. But afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way. While other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX. sfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars. When a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX. vlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH. The vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool. In the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes. Essentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY. But, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks. The first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX. CVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022. Although recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value. The second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant. The regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX. Depending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them. The instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time. A third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News. This target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX. Asymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment. Since the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked. The impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period. Of the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high. As the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here. Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: PayPal recently enlisted the help of crypto solutions provider Trident Digital to increase liquidity and use of its PYUSD stablecoin across DeFi. Trident\u2019s first move was to set up a liquidity pool on Curve Finance, one of the most popular places to trade stablecoins in DeFi. It also provided over $132,000 worth of bribes: incentives paid out to those who provide liquidity for PYUSD on Curve. Additionally, Trident proposed that lending protocol Aave let its users lend and borrow against PYUSD. A preliminary vote that ended last week showed Aave token holders overwhelming support the idea. Trident\u2019s push to boost PYUSD liquidity appears to be working. Over the past month, PYUSD has increased its circulating supply by over 33% to over 294 million Trading volumes are increasing too. PYUSD looks set to experience its highest volume week of trading since it launched last August. Still, PYUSD has a long way to go if it wants to challenge top stablecoins like those from Circle and Tether, which have a combined circulating supply of over 120 billion. The recent efforts to increase liquidity signal that PayPal is no crypto tourist \u2014 it\u2019s here for the long run. If PYUSD\u2019s success continues, other traditional payment providers will likely take note. DL News\u2019 DeFi Correspondent Aleks Gilbert investigated an ongoing spat between part time Harmony contractor Aaron Li and Harmony software engineer Casey Gardiner. The pair give conflicting accounts about a bug that mistakenly created $2.2 million worth of ONE \u2014 Harmony\u2019s native token. Gardiner accused Li of withholding information about the severity of the bug and delaying its fix, while receiving and selling some of the erroneously minted tokens. Li, in turn, defended the sale, and accused Gardiner of slow-walking the fix and compounding the problem. The recent drama adds to previous controversies at Harmony, which include accusations of mismanagement and a $100 million theft by North Korean crime syndicate the Lazarus Group. Despite a wave of new hires and a push to reposition itself after its meteoric boom and bust in 2022, Harmony deposits failed to recover with the broader crypto market last year. Proposals and upgrades to link together previously unconnected blockchains are becoming more prevalent. Oasis Network, a privacy-focused layer 1 blockchain, just announced a cross-chain expansion of its wROSE token to Pancakeswap on BNB Chain, using Celer Network\u2019s cBridge. Restaking protocol EigenLayer also hinted at connecting the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems in a recent blog post. Not to be left out, Maestro, a dApp developer platform for Cardano, is proposing cross-chain native swaps Between the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano blockchains. The ability to send crypto assets between blockchains is a top priority for builders. It reduces the friction involved in moving capital, and in some cases can even allow developers to build multi-chain DeFi protocols that users can interact with from numerous different blockchains. With many new cross-chain protocols coming to market, and an existing one confirming a highly-anticipated token, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for interoperability. Launched on December 27, the FRAX+PYUSD pool on Curve Finance has quickly become the third-biggest pool on the protocol with over $135 million of deposits. Helping the pool attract deposits are its lucrative bribes: incentives given out to those who provide liquidity. Last week, Frax supplied over $150,000 worth of its FXS token as bribes for liquidity providers. The FRAX+PYUSD pool received over $150,000 worth of bribes last week, and is currently the third-biggest stablecoin pool on Curve.

                "keypoints": "Deposits in EigenLayer topped $1 billion Wednesday.\nThe rising tide has lifted some boats in Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking business.\nBut not everyone thinks the mad rush to EigenLayer is worth celebrating.",
                "body": " Crypto deposited in Ethereum \u201crestaking\u201d protocol EigenLayer has surpassed $1 billion less than 48 hours after it opened its doors again as part of its slow-motion launch. EigenLayer raised a cap on user deposits Monday. The subsequent rush has lifted overlooked players in the booming liquid staking business. Swell, a liquid staking protocol that launched in April, has been the biggest beneficiary. Crypto deposited in Swell has grown more than 50% since Sunday, to $186 million, according to data from DefiLlama. Stader, a competitor, has also grown, albeit modestly. Deposits there are up almost 5% since Sunday, and were just above $250 million Wednesday. Both have been the beneficiaries of a mad rush to EigenLayer, one of the most hyped projects to debut on Ethereum this year. That rush has put a spotlight on still-simmering excitement surrounding restaking, a relatively new opportunity in the fast-moving crypto economy, as well as the power of point systems, which are becoming increasingly popular in decentralised finance. Previously, EigenLayer had allowed users to deposit one of three liquid staking tokens \u2014 Lido\u2019s stETH, Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, or Coinbase\u2019s cbETH \u2014 and paused deposits after it received tokens equivalent to almost 150,000 Ether. In addition to raising the deposit cap to 500,000 Ether on Monday, EigenLayer began allowing users to deposit six other liquid staking tokens, including those from Swell and Stader. The sum of crypto deposited in EigenLayer \u2014 which includes liquid staking tokens as well as 77,000 Ether \u201cnatively\u201d restaked on the platform \u2014 topped $1 billion on Wednesday, boosted in part by a 4% jump in the price of Ether and the liquid staking tokens effectively pegged to it. Staking is the practice of committing one\u2019s Ether to secure the Ethereum blockchain. Participants earn a modest annual yield in return. When EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking\u201d: allowing users to commit liquid staking tokens \u2014 which represent already staked Ether \u2014 on other decentralised applications on Ethereum and other blockchains. And when EigenLayer completes its phased rollout next year, people who have re-stake their Ether will enjoy larger annual yields than they would otherwise. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned the restaking could threaten the network\u2019s stability. Echoing Buterin, JPMorgan analysts are wary that that restaking will lead to a \u201ccascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value.\u201d EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan has told DL News he understands the fear and will move cautiously. Deposit caps have been part of the project\u2019s better-safe-than-sorry rollout. But it hasn\u2019t been slow enough, according to Mike Silagadze, co-founder of liquid staking protocol Ether.Fi. \u201cI\u2019m actually a very big supporter of the protocol and restaking in general,\u201d Silagadze told DL News. But convincing people to deposit their liquid staking tokens now could lead to disappointment down the road, he said. That\u2019s because EigenLayer won\u2019t have any revenue-generating activity until it launches a sister product next spring, EigenDA. Even then, it might not generate enough revenue to sate restakers\u2019 expectation for a boosted annual yield. \u201cThe rewards for restaking are going to be pretty minimal to start,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cA risk of having too much TVL is, people are going to be, like, \u2018I\u2019m getting an extra 0.1% yield, forget this restaking crap.\u2019 So that\u2019s another concerning thing about all the hype \u2014 and, frankly, mania.\u201d EigenLayer will consider adding support for liquid staking tokens from Frax, Mantle, and Liquid Collective in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d EigenDA is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.

The reports have been in the works for a couple of years, said Chuck Mounts, the chief DeFi officer at S&P. \u201cWe engaged with maybe almost 1,000 external stakeholders,\u201d Mounts told DL News. \u201cOne consistent thing we heard from that wide range of stakeholders is the fact that there\u2019s a lack of an ability to really understand the risks that are inherent in different kinds of stablecoins.\u201d In several reports published Tuesday, S&P Global gave US-based stablecoins an edge, citing the low-risk assets backing them. The firm ranked the stablecoins on a scale of one to five, with one being best. No stablecoin earned S&P\u2019s highest rating. But USDC, GUSD and USDP were each slotted in the firm\u2019s second tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cstrong.\u201d Tether was in the fourth tier, reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cconstrained.\u201d More decentralised alternatives DAI And FRAX also received poor scores: DAI, issued by Maker, was in the fourth tier, while FRAX was in the fifth, which is reserved for stablecoins considered \u201cweak.\u201d To calculate its ratings, S&P relied largely on the quality of assets backing the stablecoins, their degree of collateralisation, and their liquidation mechanism. Other factors included token governance, the legal and regulatory framework in which the tokens are issued, plus their redeemability, their liquidity, third-party dependencies, and their track record. Like Bluechip, a stablecoin-specific ratings nonprofit that launched earlier this year, S&P gave high marks to US-based stablecoins. Circle, Gemini Trust Company and Paxos Trust Co. received the most favourable marks. Circle\u2019s USDC is backed mostly by low-risk assets: US Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, 95% of which are held in the Circle Reserve Fund at BlackRock, the giant asset management firm. The remaining 5% are held at unnamed \u201cregulated financial institutions\u201d to \u201cfacilitate the USDC issuance and redemptions,\u201d according to its monthly attestation reserve reports, which are reviewed by Deloitte. But S&P docked points from USDC over uncertainty as to what might happen in the event Circle files for bankruptcy. Circle claims that USDC reserves would be shielded from the company\u2019s creditors in that event. But S&P\u2019s analysts aren\u2019t so sure. They said it was unclear whether people who hold USDC would be able to redeem them for dollars if Circle filed for bankruptcy, or whether the assets that back USDC would get tied up in lengthy legal proceedings. S&P also said USDC\u2019s track record wasn\u2019t perfect. The token briefly slipped from its dollar peg earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The bank held more than $3 billion in USDC reserves, and when investors rushed to redeem their USDC the stablecoin fell to as low as 86 cents. While Gemini\u2019s GUSD also received high marks for the mix of collateral assets and its oversight by New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services, S&P analysts didn\u2019t like its lack of liquidity on secondary markets. GUSD has a relatively meagre market capitalisation, much of it locked away as collateral for Maker\u2019s DAI. Paxos\u2019 USDP also benefitted from a mix of low-risk assets, but was dinged for holding its deposits \u201cat a variety of rated as well as unrated banks.\u201d Tether\u2019s USDT received relatively poor marks for its asset mix and lack of transparency. While low-risk assets make up the majority of Tether\u2019s collateral, some 15% are in \u201criskier assets,\u201d such as precious metals, secured loans, and \u201cother investments with limited transparency on their composition,\u201d S&P said. The firm also faulted Tether for not providing a fulsome explanation of the \u201centities\u201d that serve as the platform\u2019s custodians, counterparties, or banks. It didn\u2019t help that Tether doesn\u2019t answer to any particular regulator. 'We see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u2019 \u201cThis contrasts with some stablecoin issuers that are subject to regulatory oversight by an authority, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services,\u201d S&P said. \u201cWe see the lack of regulation and/or supervision of USDT as a weakness.\u201d As was the case with USDC, the lack of certainty as to what would happen in a bankruptcy was also cause for concern. Tether did not immediately return a request for comment. Maker\u2019s DAI was faulted for its reliance on real-world assets. Although real-world assets have boosted Maker\u2019s profits over the past two years, they also introduce relatively illiquid credit risk and would be difficult to convert to cash in an emergency, according to S&P. Maker and DAI are governed by a digital cooperative, MakerDAO. This crypto-native governance structure poses its own issues, the ratings firm said. While DAOs provide transparency regarding on-chain assets and upcoming changes, S&P noted, control of Maker is highly concentrated. \u201cThis is especially true when considering active voters,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cIn particular, co-founder Rune Christensen maintains significant influence in the MakerDAO community.\u201d FRAX, meanwhile, received poor marks because the collateral backing it is worth less than the amount of the stablecoin in circulation. While most of the collateral is in stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, some comes in the form of FXS, a sister token. True USD and First Digital USD were slotted in the fifth and fourth tiers, respectively, due to limited information regarding the creditworthiness of institutions holding their collateral.\u201d True USD was also dinged for a lack of information \u201con the nature of the assets in the reserve.\u201d Charles Jansen, the head of DeFi Transformation at S&P, said the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST stablecoin in May 2022 put a spotlight on the need for a framework others can use to gauge major stablecoins. Some risk assessment startups at the time \u201chad UST as their number one safest coin,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, some just disappeared, some renamed, and some just deleted that from their database.\u201d Jansen said the firm would consider analysing other stablecoins in the future, including decentralised stablecoins and those issued by banks. Mounts agreed. \u201cThis is our starting point,\u201d Mounts said. \u201cThis is not the endpoint.\u201d Aleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York correspondent. Have a tip about DeFi or stablecoins?

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. GM, Tim here, Here\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently: After stealing $48 million from KyberSwap users in what some have called the most complex DeFi exploit ever, the attacker is back with an ultimatum. \u201cMy demands are as follows: Read the full message here. You might be wondering why the exploiter fancies attaching himself to a registered company, as they would need reveal their identity to do so. But a clue to the exploiter\u2019s identity may be able to shed some light on what they hope to accomplish. Shortly after the Kyber exploit, keen-eyed DeFi watchers noticed \u2014 and we confirmed \u2014 that a wallet connected to the Kyber exploiter sent $2 million to a wallet associated with Andean Medjedovic, the Indexed Finance exploiter. There is no official confirmation. But any exploit would fall in line with a code is law mantra. Medjedovic declined our attempts to be interviewed about this topic. To this day, Medjedovic maintains his exploits were not theft but merely profitable trades. If it is indeed him, it may be that Medjedovic is looking to improve his image in the eyes of the law, in response to a 2021 warrant out for his arrest on charges relating to the hack. Getting control of Kyber would help in arguing such a case to local authorities. Medjedovic previously told DL News he was in hiding after stealing $15 million from Indexed Finance in October 2021. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone in crypto has attempted to improve their reputation. Ethereum layer 2 Starknet mistakenly published a webpage outlining eligibility criteria for its upcoming token airdrop, sparking a wave of excitement among DeFi users. But for many, the excitement was short-lived. That\u2019s because the criteria for receiving tokens were not as lax as many had hoped. (Starknet) For those who have followed Starknet development over the years, the leaked criteria shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Starkware\u2019s creators have said on multiple occasions they want the planned STRK token airdrop to benefit those who genuinely contributed to its development, and not those trying to game the system. Still, a post from the official Starknet Foundation X account emphasised that the leaked draft was not final, leaving the door open for additional criteria. The post also confirmed that the cutoff date for becoming eligible for the airdrop had passed. Curvance, a new omnichain lending protocol, has announced a $3.6 million raise \u2014 but with a twist. The protocol has eschewed the traditional route of tapping large venture capital firms for funding, and instead raised exclusively from individual contributors and DAOs. Among those taking a punt on the new protocol are Polygon\u2019s Sandeep Nailwal, Wormhole Labs CEO Saeed Badreg, and Frax DAO. Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola told DL News that the decision to turn down big name VCs meant more work, but that it was \u201cwell worth it knowing our round is backed by individuals who have a personal stake in the game\u201d DeFi projects are receiving more and more scrutiny over who bankrolls them. Those that sold equity or tokens to the wrong venture firms often still suffer the negative baggage of doing so years later. Solana and many of its DeFi projects are a prime example of this.  November has officially become the worst month for crypto hacks this year. The $126 million theft from Justin Sun\u2019s Poloniex exchange marked the biggest loss in November followed by the Heco bridge at $86.6 million, and the KyberSwap exploit in third. (DefiLla) PROPOSAL: DYdX wants to activate trading rewards and a six-month incentive program on dYdX Chain VOTE: Arbitrum DAO to extend deadline for STIP and backfund grantees VOTE: Alphagrowth finalises growth program for Compound Euler Labs\u2019 Laurence Day shows former Citi director Sean Tuffy that crypto really is what you make of it. Jito Labs is the latest Solana DeFi protocol to announce a token airdrop. Some onlookers speculate that Jito power users could walk away with more than $100,000, depending on how the market values the upcoming JTO token. Have you joined our Telegram channel yet?

                "keypoints": "Asset-backed \u2014 These stablecoins are backed one-to-one with the asset they represent. For fiat stablecoins, these backing assets can include cash or cash equivalents like government-issued bonds.",
                "body": " Stablecoins are arguably one of the most important crypto inventions. They let investors easily switch between volatile crypto assets \u2014 like Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 and more stable fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Euro, without having to reenter the traditional financial system. Competition in the burgeoning stablecoin sector is hot. Currently, Tether\u2019s dollar-pegged USDT is the top crypto stablecoin with a market capitalisation of over $88 billion. Big Tech has also stepped up to the plate with payments giant PayPal launching its own crypto stablecoin PYUSD in August. But the lack of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US could spell uncertainty for dollar-denominated stablecoins. In the name of global adoption, the crypto community is rooting for any genuine attempt at a trustworthy digital dollar \u2013 especially given all the fear, uncertainty and doubt weighing on existing stablecoin issuers over the past year. So what\u2019s the good and bad with blockchain bucks these days? DefiLlama has its own section dedicated to exploring the crypto market\u2019s numerous stablecoins. Over 120 stablecoin projects across more than 80 blockchains make up the $127 billion stablecoin market cap reported in DefiLlama\u2019s \u201cStables\u201d overview dashboard. Users can filter tokens by a number of metrics such as market cap, type of backing, what asset they\u2019re pegged to, what chains they\u2019re available on, and more. Upon entering the Stables overview dashboard, users are greeted with a historical timeline of the market capitalisation of all major stablecoins.  Here we can see Tether\u2019s USDT (green) has stayed strong over the past year, while its biggest rival, Circle\u2019s USDC, has fallen in popularity. The chart also has the option to take a step back and look at the stablecoin market in its entirety. Let\u2019s select \u201cTotal Market Cap\u201d from the dropdown box in the upper left corner and see what it shows.  The red line shows the market capitalisation of all stablecoins. Since the collapse of the Terra blockchain\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022, dollars, in the form of stablecoins, have fled the market. But, as the data shows, that trend could be changing. In addition to stablecoin market cap data, the chart also has the option to show data for stablecoin dominance, US dollar inflows and token inflows. Below the main chart is a table where you can find everything you need to know about a specific stablecoin. Like other DefiLlama dashboards, clicking the top of each column will filter stablecoins by that specific metric. Users can also click into each asset to get a more comprehensive view of its performance.  DefiLlama also provides a Stablecoin Chains dashboard. Here users can find out the dominant stablecoin on a specific blockchain, how many stablecoins are in circulation there, and several other helpful metrics. A chart at the top of the page shows the number of stablecoins on all major blockchains.  Here we can see that Ethereum (red) holds the most stablecoins. But another gladiator has been battling in the arena as of late \u2014 TRON (blue). After increasing its share of the stablecoin market throughout 2023, TRON is now the closest it has ever been to overtaking Ethereum as the dominant blockchain for stablecoins. In all the examples we\u2019ve looked at, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by a centralised custodian \u2014 like USDT and USDC \u2014 are the most dominant. But, as we\u2019ll see, there are other ways to issue stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a one-to-one peg with the asset they represent, and there are different ways of achieving this. The three main types of stablecoin are as follows: Other stablecoins, such as those pegged to the price of gold, hold physical gold or gold derivatives in reserve. Circle\u2019s USDC, or Tether\u2019s XAUT are examples of dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. MakerDAO\u2019s DAI is an example of an overcollateralised stablecoin, and is issued in exchange for locking up Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, other asset-backed stablecoins, and more recently, real-world assets like bonds. Without regulations ordering asset-backed stablecoin issuers to prove they hold adequate reserves, they usually try to reassure investors that their stablecoins are backed one-to-one in other ways. For example, USDC issuer Circle produces monthly attestations conducted by auditing firm Deloitte to prove that it holds more assets than liabilities and could redeem all USDC in circulation for US dollars, if it needed to. Others, like USDT issuer Tether, are less transparent. Tether\u2019s reserves have been a source of speculation since USDT launched in 2014. Although the company details the assets it holds to back USDT and produces quarterly attestations on its holdings, it has never undergone a formal audit. Because of this, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a constant point of issue among crypto investors. The reserves of overcollateralised offerings like MakerDAO\u2019s DAI or Frax\u2019s FRAX are verifiable 24/7 simply by looking at the onchain smart contracts which govern them."

                "body": " Spend enough time reading about crypto and DeFi and you\u2019ll come across forks, a pretty enigmatic term for those who don\u2019t spend their days digging through Github repositories. But fear not \u2014 forks are easy to understand. Forking refers to any time a developer copies open-source code and uses it as the base for a new, separate project. In DeFi this most often takes the form of copying the code for an existing protocol and deploying it again, sometimes on a different blockchain, and often with small but significant changes. Some of the largest DeFi protocols are forks. In 2020, Sushiswap, a fork of decentralised exchange Uniswap, reached a total value locked of over $8 billion at its peak as it challenged the dominance of the protocol whose code it had copied. Uniswap had a TVL of around $10 billion at the time. But forking isn\u2019t limited to DeFi protocols. The blockchains that an entire DeFi ecosystem is built on can also be forked. The term is also used to describe any time blockchain developers agree to implement an update. When updating, developers must create a fork, as most blockchains cannot be updated without doing so. As we\u2019ll explore later, forks can be contentious, and some have created great schisms within blockchain communities. But first, let\u2019s explore how to use DeFiLlama to track DeFi protocol forks. To navigate to Forks dashboard, click on the DeFi tab on the left of the DefiLlama home page then click on the forks subsection. At the top of the dashboard are two charts showing the popularity of different forks. Uniswap v2 is currently the most-forked protocol, accounting for almost 35% of all the forks DefiLlama tracks. Uniswap v2, Compound v2, and Aave v3 are the three most commonly forked DeFi protocols. (DefiLlama) Lower down you\u2019ll find a list of 88 different DeFi protocols and all the forks that use their code. The list includes three columns. This first shows the number of forks of a protocol, the second shows the total value locked \u2014 or TVL \u2014 in that protocol, and the third shows the TVL of all forks of that protocol relative to its own. The greater this figure is, the more successful the spinoffs are that used the original protocol\u2019s code. DefiLlama's list of protocols with active forks. (DefiLlama) Take Solidly for example, an exchange protocol whose forks have amassed a TVL 105,511% that of the original. Solidly\u2019s launch was marred by bugs, and so bad was its reception that its creator, Andre Cronje, quit the project just three weeks after launch. But other developers eyed opportunity where Cronje gave up, and forked the protocol into more successful projects, like Velodrome. Many forks are near identical copies of existing protocols, just deployed on a different blockchain. However, some use the existing protocol as a starting block to build something completely new. For example, Frax Swap is a fork of Uniswap v2, but it is just one part of the larger Frax protocol that also includes an Ether liquid staking protocol and an algorithmic stablecoin. Forking doesn\u2019t just apply to the code behind DeFi protocols. As blockchains are also just lines of code on computers, they too can be forked. The most common reason to fork a blockchain is to implement an upgrade. Blockchains have no centralised point of control, so everyone running nodes on the network must agree to switch to the upgraded version of the blockchain and leave the old one behind. This is sometimes referred to as a blockchain\u2019s social consensus. Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade in April 2023 is a recent example of a blockchain fork. The update changed Ethereum\u2019s underlying code to allow users to withdraw staked Ether from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. However, while everyone running Ethereum nodes agreed on the Shapella fork and switched over to the new network, this doesn\u2019t always happen. In 2016, an incident known as the DAO hack ruptured the Ethereum network, causing it to split into two blockchains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A hacker stole $60 million worth of Ether \u2014 about 14% of all Ether in circulation at that time \u2014 from The DAO, an early decentralised autonomous organisation that intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm. After much debate, a majority of Ethereum stakeholders chose to fork the blockchain, effectively rolling back Ethereum\u2019s history to before the hack. This rolled back version is the main version of Ethereum used today. However, the decision was controversial \u2014 blockchains are meant to be immutable. Those who disagreed with the decision to roll back Ethereum continued to support the original blockchain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is not the only forked blockchain. Bitcoin also has several forked versions that are still active, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, and Litecoin."

                "body": " Lido is on quite a run. According to DefiLlama data, deposits on Lido have soared 188%, to $17 billion, this year. The cause? Big changes in the staking market. When Ethereum executed its Shapella upgrade in April, the move opened up withdrawals from the blockchain\u2019s staking contract. This alleviated an important concern for many prospective stakers \u2014 claiming back their coins. Until then, it was only Ethereum\u2019s most firm believers who were willing to risk tying up their Ether in staking. But after Shapella, staking became a two-way street, letting users freely stake and withdraw Ether. The reduced risk led to an influx of deposits that buoyed Ether staking to record highs. This was a huge lift for Lido, a so-called liquid staking platform that enables investors to stake their crypto for a number of blockchains, including Ethereum. Users rushed for a slice of the yields generated by staking Ether. With little new money entering DeFi this year, other top protocols, such as Maker, Aave, and Uniswap have remained flat. But this hasn\u2019t held back Lido, which gains deposits primarily from the unstaked Ether already sloshing around onchain. Lido isn\u2019t the only liquid staking platform out there. Competitors like Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ether deposits. But Lido accounts for 77% of the total Ether liquid staking market. Many stakers prefer Lido over similar protocols due to the deep liquidity of its staking receipt token, stETH. With more stETH liquidity, DeFi users suffer less slippage when trading between it and other tokens on decentralised exchanges. Some have raised concerns that Lido\u2019s dominance could threaten Ethereum\u2019s decentralisation. Even so, 2023 was the year of Lido, and it doesn\u2019t look like this DeFi behemoth will lose its top spot anytime soon. Ana \u0106uri\u0107 is an investigative journalist and researcher at DL News.

                "body": " A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter. Sign up here. Hey everyone, Tim here. The recent code exploits befalling friend.tech copycat Stars Arena have once again highlighted the dangers of throwing money into forks of popular protocols. On the surface, the way forks function appears practically identical to the original protocol they\u2019re based on \u2014 they use much of the same code after all. But the devil is always in the details. Just because code works in one implementation doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s guaranteed to work the same elsewhere. Stars Arena suffered two exploits recently. Although the first was relatively minor, only costing the protocol\u2019s users about $2,000, it turned out to be a sign of deeper problems. Less than 48 hours after the first exploit, hackers found a much more serious breach that wiped all $3 million of user deposits. The allure of forks is clear to see. Friend.tech\u2019s rapid success left many DeFi degens sidelined. When clones start popping up on other blockchains, those who missed out the first time felt they had another shot to hit it big. But, as crypto personality Jordan Fish a.k.a cobie points out, the rewards of putting money into forks are rarely worth the risks. Cobie weighs in on friend.tech fork Stars Arena. (@cobie) Continuing on the theme of hacks, the FTX hacker who swiped $450 million from the exchange shortly after it declared bankruptcy last year has started moving their ill-gotten gains. The destination: Bitcoin \u2014 via a DeFi exchange on THORChain called THORSwap. Unfortunately for THORSwap, having a known hacker send millions worth of crypto through your exchange is problematic to say the least. THORSwap\u2019s team, many of whom are reportedly based in the US, chose to shut down THORSwap\u2019s website frontend after consulting with their legal counsel and law enforcement. It\u2019s likely this sort of response will become more common across DeFi. If there\u2019s a way to shut down a protocol \u2014 even just the website that lets users interact with it \u2014 developers will do it, if for no other reason than a show of good faith that they stand against criminal activity. Of course, for any tech savvy hackers, shutting down websites does nothing. They can still interact with a protocol\u2019s smart contracts directly, or using other frontends. If authorities are content with protocols just blocking problematic addresses from using their frontends, I\u2019d count that as a blessing. But based on what has happened with privacy protocol Tornado Cash, I don\u2019t think that will be the case. On a more positive note, lending protocol MakerDAO has tripled its profit forecast by taking advantage of high US bond yields and delivering the rewards to holders of its Dai stablecoin. The strategy is so successful, other protocols, such as Frax Finance, are following suit. Some oppose integrating so-called real-world assets into DeFi, believing it should remain distinct from traditional finance. To me, it\u2019s one of the only things keeping DeFi relevant to those outside the space. As long as the protocols engaging with US Treasuries manage their risk well and rates stay higher for longer \u2014 as the Fed keeps telling us \u2014 I can see the sector continuing to grow. In addition to MakerDAO and Frax, check out smaller players such as Ondo Finance and Matrix Dock to see how the nascent real-world asset sector is innovating. Real-world assets like US Treasuries now make up over 50% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. This figure was around 12% at the start of the year. Real world assets on MakerDAO's balance sheet (Dune Analytics/@steakhouse) VOTE: GMX asks Arbitrum DAO for 12 million ARB VOTE: Dopex asks Arbitrum DAO for 1.5 million ARB VOTE: Lido asks Arbitrum DAO for 4 million ARB Molly is one of several to point out the similarities between the financial and geopolitical situations in 2009 and today using The Times headline enshrined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ether liquid staking provider Lido approaches a 33% share of all Ether staked on Ethereum, potentially creating a centralisation risk for the blockchain. Aave companies CEO Stani Kulechov appears to suggest Aave build a Lido competitor. The last time Kulechov threw out an idea like this on social media, we got Lens Protocol.

                "body": " DeFi protocols that pool users\u2019 Ether for staking are exposed to funds tied to money laundering, scams, sanctioned addresses and malicious actors, according to a new report by digital asset infrastructure provider Northstake shared with DL News. While the proportion of dirty to clean funds is small, it may still present challenges for institutional investors bound by stringent regulations. The report looked at three of the top Ether liquid staking protocols and found each had been exposed to funds tied directly to illicit activities, as well as those connected to high-risk crypto exchanges and gambling sites that don\u2019t require users to pass know-your-customer checks. Sebastian Heine, Northstake\u2019s chief of risk and compliance, said they are likely underestimating exposure. \u201cThe dark number is probably significantly higher,\u201d Heine told DL News, referring to the actual amount of illicit or otherwise questionable crypto found in the staking protocols Northstake analysed. \u201cEven though we have good tracking tools on blockchain, it still needs human effort, time, and expertise to identify these addresses and clusters which are related to sanctioned transactions,\u201d he said. Northstake found that total illicit and high-risk exposure was small \u2014 between 0.46% and 1.56% across the three protocols the report examined. Still, according to Northstake, this creates a serious dilemma for regulated entities looking to dip their toes in liquid staking protocols. The report doesn\u2019t identify the liquid staking protocols it analysed. Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest liquid staking protocols, did not immediately return DL News\u2019 requests for comment. \u2018Regulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain.\u2019 \u201cThe level of exposure raises concerns and questions about acceptable thresholds for exposure to illicit funds, which an institutional investor is either willing to accept or legally allowed to carry,\u201d the report said. Liquid staking protocols remove complexity in Ether staking and increase market efficiency. They stake depositors\u2019 Ether for them and give out placeholder tokens, called liquid staking tokens, in return. They are also sometimes called liquid staking derivatives, though some note that the term \u201cderivatives\u201d comes with regulatory baggage. These liquid staking tokens automatically accrue Ether staking rewards while also letting holders use them elsewhere, like as collateral for taking out DeFi loans. This year, the Ether liquid staking market has exploded. In January, Lido, the largest Ether liquid staking provider, held $5.8 billion in deposits. Over the course of the year, that figure increased to $14.5 billion \u2014 a 150% gain. There\u2019s a lot institutional stakers must consider, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. \u201cRegulated institutions have a matrix of issues to grapple with to access staking on the Ethereum blockchain, whether this is through the use of liquid staking, validators or crypto staking ETPs,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cRegulated institutions will bring rigorous due diligence to this analysis, helped by blockchain analytics, in an effort to select the platforms which present the lowest risk to them.\u201d But Northstake\u2019s figures also have to be put in perspective. \u201cIf a rule is applied that an investor cannot invest if there are some rogue actors, then it may well exclude many investment asset classes,\u201d he said. According to estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered every year. That equates to between $800 billion to $2 trillion a year. Meanwhile, only $16 billion worth of crypto is locked in liquid staking protocols, according to DefiLlama data. \u201cIf we assume the worst case that 1.5% is criminal behaviour, this equates to between 0.012% and 0.031% of global money laundering,\u201d Butterfill told DL News. \u201cThis is remarkably low relative to other currencies, given that at one point according to SOCA [the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency], that 90% of all 500 Euro notes sold in the UK were in the hands of organised crime.\u201d In traditional finance, it can be hard to ascertain one\u2019s actual exposure to illicit or questionable funds. Crypto is different, according to Northstake CEO Jesper Johansen. \u201cWe can actually document this on-chain,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of blockchain, the transparency. So the question is actually turned on its head: Would you, as an institutional investor, be willing to accept a half a percent documented exposure to sanctioned funds when making your investment? And I think the answer comes out at zero \u2014 as in, \u2018no, I would not accept that.\u2019 \" Ether liquid staking protocols usually do not require users to pass any form of know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks \u2014 DeFi is largely permissionless after all. While institutional investors may remain hesitant due to the counterparty risk involved with using liquid staking protocols, they are popular with retail investors, who aren\u2019t affected by potential exposure to illicit funds. \u201cIt\u2019s purely from the institutional investor point of view that we see this issue,\u201d Johansen said, \u201cbecause they have a fiduciary obligation to their investors to record any exposure that they have in their investments to the relevant competent authorities.\u201d Tim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

                "headline": "Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could be a problem, Fed researchers say",
                "keypoints": "Some stablecoins and money market funds \u201clook remarkably similar.\u201d\nBoth are vulnerable to runs in which investors flee to safer assets.\nIf stablecoins become mainstream, they could \u201cbecome a source of financial instability.\u201d",
                "body": " Stablecoins are a lot like money market funds \u2014 and that could pose a threat to the broader financial system, according to researchers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve system. A new research report published by the New York Fed finds that stablecoins have several parallels with money market funds, a type of SEC-registered mutual fund that aims for price stability through relatively low-risk investments. More than $5 trillion in assets has been invested in money market funds, the authors estimated. Like money market funds, stablecoins give their investors money-like assets, are vulnerable to runs, and, in times of stress may exhibit a \u201cflight to safety\u201d in which investors swap them for other assets they believe are less risky. \u201cThese run and flight-to-safety dynamics in stablecoins are similar to those observed in the MMF industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cShould stablecoins continue to grow and become more interconnected with key financial markets, such as short-term funding markets, they could become a source of financial instability for the broader financial system.\u201d There are three types of money market funds: government funds, which invest in cash treasuries and similar assets; prime funds, which can also invest in commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and tax-exempt funds, which can also invest in debt issued by local governments. \u201cAmong stablecoins backed by traditional financial assets, US-based stablecoins (BUSD, USDP, and USDC) look remarkably similar to government MMFs,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, the offshore, asset-backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) is backed by a wider mix of assets that includes commercial paper and certificates of deposit, similarly to prime MMFs.\u201d The researchers analysed periods of stress for money market funds as well as stablecoins. Runs on money market funds were prompted by the Great Recession in 2008, the European Union\u2019s 2011 debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In each instance, investors fled from prime funds to government funds, which were considered safer, according to the authors. Runs on stablecoins considered by the researchers include the collapse of Terra in 2020 and of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. When Terra collapsed, USDC was the beneficiary, \u201cas investors at that time deemed it the safest stablecoin because it reportedly held Treasury securities and bank deposits, assets generally regarded as safe.\u201d Tether, meanwhile, with its commercial paper and other securities, suffered. But USDC wasn\u2019t so lucky when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March. Because the bank held 8% of the assets backing USDC, traders dumped the token, sending its price as low as $0.88. Investors also dumped FRAX And DAI \u2014 stablecoins backed, in large part, by USDC. Tether grew, with inflows pushing its price as high as $1.03. To be sure, there are some key differences between money market funds and stablecoins, such as the assets that back them and investors\u2019 rights \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to redeem those assets. Additionally, in contrast with money market funds, stablecoins are not regulated by the SEC and appeal primarily to retail investors, the authors wrote. Got a tip on stablecoins?
