                "body": " A new stablecoin rating agency just released a ranking of top 15 stablecoins. But no stablecoin got full marks. The agency \u2014 a non-profit called Bluechip \u2014 wants to offer a reliable resource for crypto investors to understand the relative safety of the different pegged assets that power much of the crypto industry. Bluechip works similarly to Wall Street rating agencies such as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, which provide ratings for various investment products. But Bluechip uses more familiar US school grading instead of bond ratings \u2014 assigning letter grades to stablecoins ranging from A+, the highest possible grade, to a failing grade of F. NOW READ: Investors pull $4bn from Binance as regulators and rivals close in No stablecoin earned the top A+ indicating it is \u201chighly stable.\u201d However, four stablecoins \u2014 Binance USD, Liquity USD, Pax Gold, and Gemini Dollar \u2014 received an A, the second-best grade. Bluechip's stablecoin ratings (Bluechip) On the other end of the spectrum, Bluechip gave USDD, a stablecoin with connections to the Tron blockchain and its founder Justin Sun, a failing F grade. Explaining the grade, Bluechip said it believes that \u201cUSDD\u2019s reserves are commingled with assets of Huobi,\u201d and strongly recommend users not to use it. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of our rating system is that we favour transparency. And if claims are opaque, we\u2019re erring on the side of caution and distrust,\u201d Garett Jones, Bluechip\u2019s chief economist, told DL News in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really the audit that\u2019s the most important single factor holding back Tether.\u201d Tether, currently the biggest stablecoin by market cap and deployed across 14 different blockchains, as well as TrueUSD and Frax, all received a D grade, indicating that they are \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to Tether, what ends up holding the rating down to a fairly low level is the lack of an audit \u2014 the fact that people can\u2019t be credibly convinced of its reserve plans,\u201d Jones said. NOW READ: \u2018Tether is next\u2019 says short seller who bet against Silvergate and Signature Bank Tether has long struggled to convince the crypto community it holds reserves one-to-one for its $83 billion tokens. In 2021, the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission fined Tether $41 million for making untrue or misleading statements about the reserves backing its flagship dollar-pegged stablecoin. Although Tether has since started releasing quarterly attestations, it has failed to conduct a comprehensive third-party audit of its reserves. But it\u2019s not just audits that can make or break a stablecoin\u2019s rating. Bluechip looks at numerous factors, including how well a stablecoin has historically held its peg, how transparent its governance is, and the quality of its management, among other things. \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking at whether there are deep liquidity pools for each coin, although those are important traits,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking behind that to questions of governance.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just some sort of gut feeling about whether you like the team or not.\u201d That approach stems from Jones\u2019 background. He\u2019s a professor for the Study of Capitalism at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. He also helped bring together an advisory group of other economists, including Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Alex Tabarrok and Lawrence H. White, to work on Bluechip. Other advisers include Nic Carter, general partner at VC firm Castle Island Ventures, and Ameen Soleimani, co-founder of Reflexer Labs that develops stablecoin Rai. Jones is one of the three team members behind the agency \u2014 the others are Austria-based CEO Benjamin Levit, and India-based ratings director Vaidya Pallasena, an accountant by training. Bluechip has received donations from Rune Christensen, co-founder of MakerDAO behind stablecoin Dai; stablecoin issuance platform Reserve\u2019s co-founder Nevin Freeman; Ethereum scaling solution Starkware\u2019s co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson; InnovaticGroup and others.

Jones realises stablecoin rating is a contentious practice. Others in the industry may disagree with Bluechip\u2019s results, which are subject to change if a stablecoin\u2019s fundamentals improve or deteriorate. \u201cWe look forward to people disagreeing with us or agreeing with us, coming up with their own way of saying, \u2018we wish you had rated this a little bit differently,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cUltimately, one of our goals is to encourage stablecoin projects to feel like they will benefit if they just share more information.\u201d"
