        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

Even their vendors have said that once the TRON Network was integrated, all customers immediately preferred TRON because of its low cost and speed. \n\nIt's stories like Hakan's that motivate us to keep building the best network to serve people globally and bring real life use cases to areas like Turkey in order to better serve the underserved.  \n\nThe TRON Network: where opportunities and access have no borders.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

And number three in terms of revenues. \n\nFurthermore, 57 million unique wallet addresses interacted with the Tether stablecoin on Tron over the last year. \n\nIn fact, Tron was responsible for nearly 4 trillion in Tether transfer volumes in 2023 \u2014 nearly half the volume of Mastercard transactions last year. \n\n----\n\nIn the West there seems to be this view that the only relevant blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc. \n\nBut there are over 4.5 billion people that live in Asia.\n\nIt appears that these folks prefer alternative networks \u2014 such as Tron. \n\n----\n\nThat's why we're sharing a data-driven deep dive on Tron this week with readers ofThe DeFi ReportIf you'd like to have the free report dropped into your inbox when it's published on Wednesday, see the first comment.\n\nData: Top L1 Daily Active Users powered byToken Terminal",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions.

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

This is what he told us:\n\n'I hosted events for Score Milk...I also hosted an event at a university on how students can use the TRON blockchain in their daily lives as well as how blockchain and gaming go together.' During this event, he was able to educate these students and help them set up a TronLink wallet. He concluded by saying, \"In all, TRON has been a life saver for my family and friends.\" \n\nIt's stories like this that encourage us to continue building a network that supports our developers and our community - the ones who build applications and the ones who encourage interactions that help to grow the TRON Network.\n\nThe TRON Network: where opportunities and access have no borders.",

Other significant problems are the misalignment of the k-dss repository and the incomplete implementation of checkRely in the auth-checker.

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

And number three in terms of revenues. \n\nFurthermore, 57 million unique wallet addresses interacted with the Tether stablecoin on Tron over the last year. \n\nIn fact, Tron was responsible for nearly 4 trillion in Tether transfer volumes in 2023 \u2014 nearly half the volume of Mastercard transactions last year. \n\n----\n\nIn the West there seems to be this view that the only relevant blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc. \n\nBut there are over 4.5 billion people that live in Asia.\n\nIt appears that these folks prefer alternative networks \u2014 such as Tron. \n\n----\n\nThat's why we're sharing a data-driven deep dive on Tron this week with readers ofThe DeFi ReportIf you'd like to have the free report dropped into your inbox when it's published on Wednesday, see the first comment.\n\nData: Top L1 Daily Active Users powered byToken Terminal",

Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

Automated and manual testing methods were used to identify vulnerabilities. The most critical findings include the susceptibility of auctions to transaction-reordering attacks and the fact that the ABIEncoderV2 is not yet ready for production use. Additionally, the k-dss repository is out of sync, and there are too many conflicting notions of \"permission\" within the system. To improve, it is recommended to regularly perform dry runs of response plans to address these issues and develop a robust security protocol.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO.

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

And number three in terms of revenues. \n\nFurthermore, 57 million unique wallet addresses interacted with the Tether stablecoin on Tron over the last year. \n\nIn fact, Tron was responsible for nearly 4 trillion in Tether transfer volumes in 2023 \u2014 nearly half the volume of Mastercard transactions last year. \n\n----\n\nIn the West there seems to be this view that the only relevant blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc. \n\nBut there are over 4.5 billion people that live in Asia.\n\nIt appears that these folks prefer alternative networks \u2014 such as Tron. \n\n----\n\nThat's why we're sharing a data-driven deep dive on Tron this week with readers ofThe DeFi ReportIf you'd like to have the free report dropped into your inbox when it's published on Wednesday, see the first comment.\n\nData: Top L1 Daily Active Users powered byToken Terminal",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO.

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years.

In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

This innovative approach aims to decentralize and intertwine various token types within the TRON network, including stablecoins, with the Bitcoin network and its constructed Layer 2s, like the Bitcoin Ordinals, in numerous combinatory ways. This integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin. Let's make#Bitcoinfun again!\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b1\n\nBitcoin has already been made accessible through cross-chain connections to the TRON network, with exchanges facilitating conversions. The future will see an expansion of Bitcoin network-based assets being bridged to TRON. Efforts will be made to integrate various TRON tokens, including#USDT,#TRX,#BTT,#JST,#SUN,#NFT,#WIN, and#USDC, into the Bitcoin network via cross-chain technology. This will enable TRON's tokens to interact and interoperate with the Bitcoin network seamlessly.\n\nTRON DAO Ventures into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions\n\nPlans are the investment for a user-friendly wallet and tools to support BRC-20 tokens, signifying TRON DAO's venture into Ordinals and Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b2\n\nTRON will collaborate with multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols, gradually announcing significant partnerships. These collaborations will allow TRON users to participate in restaking initiatives across major Bitcoin Layer 2 networks, supporting the growth of the Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem with TRON's diverse asset portfolio.\n\nRoad Map Stage \u03b3\n\nThe announcement of a Layer 2 solution that integrates TRON, BTTC, and the Bitcoin network will mark a significant milestone. This solution introduces a protocol that compatible with#Bitcoin, aiming to maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\n\nThis ambitious roadmap outlines TRON's commitment to enhancing the interoperability and utility of blockchain technologies, setting a new standard for the industry's future.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure.

TRON consistently has 2-3x as much P2P transfer volume as Ethereum, indicating \n\nTRON is facilitating more payments and money transfers, compared to DeFi activity.\u00a0 \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Average Transaction Fee\n\nTRON has consistently maintained low average transaction fees while sustaining significant activity.\n\nThe average transaction cost on TRON is 90% lower than Bitcoin and over 80% lower than Ethereum. \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 BONUS: Top App on TRON\n\nNot surprisingly, given the large amount of stablecoin and P2P transfers, the #1 application on TRON is...Tether.ioTether makes up 95% of the active addresses among top 10 dapps.\n\nThank youH.E.

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

        "profile_bio": "Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of Feb 2024, it has over 219 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 7.3 billion total transactions, and over $23.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. \n\nIn addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, with a total supply of more than $54 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the total global supply of USDT. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \ud83d\udc49 Free Tickets\uff1ahttps://lnkd.in/gQfZnGQj",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",

July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of October 2022, it has over 115 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4 billion total transactions, and over $13.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201cDMC\u201d), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.",
